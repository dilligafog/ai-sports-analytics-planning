# AI Sports Analytics - Strategic Planning

**Main Implementation Repo**: [ai-sports-analytics](https://github.com/dilligafog/ai-sports-analytics)

## Purpose

This repository manages strategic planning, story development, and roadmap evolution for the AI Sports Analytics project. It works in partnership with the main implementation repository through automated synchronization and specialized AI agents.

## Repository Structure

### üìã **Active Stories** (`active/`)
Current iteration stories being actively developed. Stories move here from backlog when development begins.

### üóÉÔ∏è **Backlog** (`backlog/`)
Prioritized future work organized by theme:
- **Foundation**: Core infrastructure and data pipeline
- **Features**: ML models, LLM integration, social media
- **Operations**: Monitoring, deployment, performance
- **User Experience**: UI, documentation, APIs

### ‚úÖ **Completed** (`completed/`)
Archived stories with links to implementation commits and PRs. Maintains traceability between planning and execution.

### üó∫Ô∏è **Roadmaps** (`roadmaps/`)
High-level strategic plans and release planning:
- Quarterly objectives
- Technology evolution
- Dependency mapping
- Resource allocation

## Agent Collaboration
