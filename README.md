## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Cross-Repository Coordination
This planning repository works seamlessly with the [implementation repository](https://github.com/dilligafog/ai-sports-analytics) through:

**Story-Driven Development**:
1. **Planning Agent** creates stories with acceptance criteria
2. **Implementation Agent** references story IDs in commits/PRs  
3. **Feedback Loop** refines future stories based on implementation learnings
4. **Completion Tracking** updates story status through JSON lifecycle management

**Synchronization Points**:
- 📅 **Daily**: Implementation checks prioritization list
- 📅 **Weekly**: Planning updates based on development progress  
- 📅 **Monthly**: Roadmap adjustments and capacity planning

## 📊 Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-28  
**Total Stories**: 98+ (actively managed)  
**Automation Status**: ✅ Fully Operational  
**Processing Capacity**: Unlimited (template + automation driven)

**Recent Achievements**:
- ✅ Eliminated manual story creation bottlenecks
- ✅ Implemented professional-grade automation toolkit
- ✅ Established consistent story formats across all epics
- ✅ Reduced story creation time from minutes to seconds

**Next Evolution**:
- 🔄 GitHub Actions integration for commit synchronization
- 🔄 Advanced analytics dashboards for story metrics
- 🔄 AI-powered story suggestion based on patterns
- 🔄 Automated dependency analysis and conflict detection

## 🎯 Usage Patterns

### For Planning Specialists
```bash
# Create epic-level story breakdown
python scripts/ingest_stories.py --template basic --title "User Authentication" --epic core

# Prioritize quarterly objectives  
python scripts/manage_priorities.py --auto-prioritize --max-priority 15

# Bulk import from stakeholder input
# (place JSON/CSV in staging/bulk/ then run ingest)
```

### For Development Teams
- **Reference**: Use story IDs in commit messages (`LLM-019: implement feature`)
- **Feedback**: Update story status and provide implementation notes
- **Planning**: Check `backlog/PRIORITIZATION.md` for next priority stories

### For Product Management
- **Roadmapping**: Use `roadmaps/` documents for strategic planning
- **Metrics**: Monitor story completion rates and velocity
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Reference `completed/` and `accepted/` for progress reports
