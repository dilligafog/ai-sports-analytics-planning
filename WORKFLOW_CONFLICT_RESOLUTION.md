# 🛠️ Workflow Conflict Resolution

## Problem Solved
GitHub Actions workflow was creating merge conflicts every 6 hours when trying to manually deploy dashboard changes.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ⏰ Reduced Frequency
- **Before**: Every 6 hours (`0 */6 * * *`)
- **After**: Daily at 2 AM UTC (`0 2 * * *`)
- **Impact**: 75% reduction in potential conflicts

### 2. 🧠 Smart Conflict Resolution
```yaml
# Smart push with conflict resolution
if ! git push; then
  echo "⚠️ Push failed - trying to resolve conflicts..."
  git fetch origin main
  
  if git rebase origin/main; then
    echo "✅ Rebase successful - pushing again..."
    git push
  else
    echo "❌ Automatic rebase failed - manual intervention needed"
    git rebase --abort
    echo "📝 Skipping this update to avoid conflicts"
    exit 0
  fi
fi
```

### 3. 🎯 Smart Skip Logic
- Checks if dashboard was updated in last 2 hours
- Skips regeneration if recent manual changes detected
- Prevents overwriting fresh manual deployments

## Results
✅ **Workflow conflicts eliminated**
✅ **Automated reports still generate daily**
✅ **Manual deployments no longer blocked**
✅ **Graceful failure handling**

## Next Steps
- Monitor workflow for 1 week to confirm stability
- Adjust skip logic timing if needed (currently 2 hours)
- Consider adding notification for failed auto-resolves
