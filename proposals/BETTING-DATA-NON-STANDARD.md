# Proposal: BETTING-DATA-NON-STANDARD - Explore Non-Standard Betting Data Sources

## Summary
Explore and integrate non-traditional betting data sources including peer-to-peer betting platforms, crypto sportsbooks, and emerging betting markets to expand our data ecosystem and improve predictive modeling capabilities.

## Motivation
Traditional sportsbook data provides valuable insights, but non-standard betting sources offer unique advantages:
- **Peer-to-peer platforms** capture real user sentiment and micro-trends not reflected in traditional odds
- **Crypto sportsbooks** operate 24/7 with global participation and different risk profiles
- **Emerging markets** provide early signals for trending events and niche sports
- **Alternative data** can improve model accuracy by capturing behavioral economics factors

This proposal aims to diversify our data sources beyond traditional sportsbooks to gain competitive advantages in predictive analytics.

## Proposed Changes

### Data Source Integration Framework
- **API Integration Layer**: Standardized interface for connecting to various betting platforms
- **Data Normalization**: Unified schema for different betting data formats and structures
- **Quality Validation**: Automated checks for data integrity and outlier detection
- **Rate Limiting & Ethics**: Responsible data collection with platform-specific constraints

### New Data Categories
- **Peer-to-peer odds**: Real-time user-generated betting lines and sentiment
- **Crypto sportsbook data**: 24/7 global betting activity and cryptocurrency-based odds
- **Prop betting markets**: Specialized wager data for player props and game events
- **Live betting streams**: Real-time betting flow and market reactions during games

### Enhanced Analytics Capabilities
- **Sentiment Analysis**: User behavior patterns from peer-to-peer platforms
- **Market Efficiency Metrics**: Compare traditional vs. alternative market pricing
- **Behavioral Economics**: Study betting patterns and decision-making factors
- **Early Warning Signals**: Detect emerging trends before traditional markets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify and document 5+ viable non-standard betting data sources
- [ ] Establish data collection framework with rate limiting and ethical guidelines
- [ ] Create unified data schema for normalizing different betting formats
- [ ] Implement data quality validation and outlier detection systems
- [ ] Demonstrate improved model accuracy with blended data sources
- [ ] Develop monitoring dashboard for data source health and performance
