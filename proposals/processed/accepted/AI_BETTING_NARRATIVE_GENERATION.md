# AI_BETTING_NARRATIVE_GENERATION: AI-Powered Betting Narrative Generation

## Overview
**Extracted from PUBLIC_BETTING_DATA_INTEGRATION story** - LLM context functionality moved to separate proposal for focused development.

## Problem Statement
The betting data integration is complete, but we lack AI-powered narrative generation that can contextualize predictions with public betting trends and market sentiment.

## Proposed Solution
Build an AI narrative generation system that creates compelling, data-driven betting analysis incorporating:
- Public betting percentages and line movements
- Market sentiment analysis
- Contrarian opportunity identification
- Risk assessment narratives

## Business Value
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Rich, contextual betting analysis
- **Competitive Differentiation**: AI-generated insights beyond basic predictions
- **Monetization Potential**: Premium narrative content
- **User Engagement**: More compelling and informative content

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] LLM API Integration (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- [ ] Basic prompt engineering for betting narratives
- [ ] Integration with existing prediction data
- [ ] Simple narrative templates

### Phase 2: Enhancement (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Public betting data integration into prompts
- [ ] Advanced prompt engineering for contrarian analysis
- [ ] Risk assessment narrative generation
- [ ] A/B testing framework for narrative quality

### Phase 3: Production (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Documentation and deployment

## Dependencies
- PUBLIC_BETTING_DATA_INTEGRATION (completed)
- AI service API access (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Prediction data pipeline

## Risk Assessment
- **API Costs**: LLM API usage could be expensive at scale
- **Content Quality**: Ensuring AI narratives are accurate and valuable
- **Performance**: LLM calls could slow down user experience
- **Regulatory**: Ensuring AI content meets betting regulations

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with AI narratives
- Narrative quality scores
- API cost per narrative
- Time to generate narratives

## Implementation Notes
- Start with simple narrative templates
- Use caching to reduce API costs
- Implement fallback to basic narratives if AI fails
- Consider hybrid approach: AI + human curation

## Next Steps
1. Evaluate LLM providers and pricing
2. Create proof-of-concept narrative generation
3. Design integration with existing UI
4. Plan A/B testing approach
