# Proposal: INF-001 - Data Layer Separation Strategy with Symbolic Links

## Summary
Implement a data layer separation strategy using symbolic links to create isolated development and production environments while sharing a master data location. This approach provides complete data isolation with minimal infrastructure overhead and strong protection against production data corruption.

## Motivation
Current infrastructure costs are running $250/month for separate production and development servers. Instead of full environment co-location, we can achieve similar cost benefits through intelligent data layer separation using symbolic links. This provides:

**Business Impact:**
- **Cost Reduction**: 28% infrastructure savings ($840/year) through server consolidation
- **Data Safety**: Complete protection against development activities affecting production data
- **Development Velocity**: Fast switching between data environments without full duplication
- **Operational Simplicity**: Single server management with clear data boundaries

## Proposed Changes

### Data Layer Architecture
```
Master Data Location (Production):
├── raw/           # Source data (read-only, shared via symlinks)
├── bronze/        # Raw → Bronze transformations (prod only)
├── silver/        # Bronze → Silver integrations (prod only)
├── gold/          # Silver → Gold aggregations (prod only)
├── models/        # Trained models (prod only)
├── predictions/   # Generated predictions (prod only)
├── results/       # Actual results tracking (prod only)
├── reports/       # Generated reports (prod only)
└── dashboard/     # Dashboard data (prod only)

Development Environment:
├── raw/           # → symlink to master/raw
├── bronze/        # Dev-specific bronze transformations
├── silver/        # Dev-specific silver integrations
├── gold/          # Dev-specific gold aggregations
├── models/        # Dev-trained models
├── predictions/   # Dev-generated predictions
├── results/       # Dev results tracking
├── reports/       # Dev reports
└── dashboard/     # Dev dashboard data
```

### Symbolic Link Strategy
- **Shared Layers**: `raw/` data symlinked to master (read-only)
- **Isolated Layers**: `bronze/` through `dashboard/` are dev-specific
- **Environment Variables**: Control symlink targets based on environment
- **Dynamic Switching**: Easy switching between dev/prod data configurations

### Protection Mechanisms
- **File Permissions**: Production data directories set to read-only for dev user
- **Validation Scripts**: Automated checks before any data operations
- **Backup Integration**: Automatic backups before destructive operations
- **Audit Logging**: Track all data access and modifications
- **Environment Guards**: Prevent accidental prod operations from dev environment

## Motivation
Current infrastructure costs are running $250/month for separate production and development servers. With only 3% of available storage utilized and low resource consumption, there's significant opportunity to consolidate environments while maintaining operational safety and development velocity.

**Business Impact:**
- **Cost Reduction**: 28% infrastructure savings ($840/year)
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better server utilization (>80% target)
- **Operational Simplicity**: Single server to monitor and maintain
- **Development Velocity**: Faster testing cycles with shared resources
