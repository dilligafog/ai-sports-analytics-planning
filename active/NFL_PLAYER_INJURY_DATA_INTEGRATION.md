# User Story: NFL Player Injury Data Integration

## Overview
**As a** betting analyst  
**I want** comprehensive player injury data integrated into our system  
**So that** I can assess the impact of injuries on game outcomes and betting lines

## Value Proposition
Injuries significantly impact game outcomes and betting lines. Integrating detailed player injury data allows for more accurate predictions and provides critical context for betting decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System collects injury data from reliable sources (official NFL injury reports, third-party APIs)
- Data includes injury type, severity, player position, and expected return timeline
- Information is standardized and integrated into machine learning features
- Historical injury data is available for backtesting
- UI shows relevant injury information for upcoming games
- LLM can reference injury data when generating betting narratives

## Technical Requirements
- Implement data collection from injury report sources
- Create schema for injury data storage
- Develop feature engineering for injury impact (team strength adjustments)
- Integrate injury data into ML pipelines
- Expose injury data to UI and LLM components

## Implementation Plan
1. Research and select optimal injury data sources
2. Implement data collection and storage
3. Create feature engineering for injury impact
4. Integrate with prediction models
5. Update UI to display injury information
6. Enhance LLM prompts to include injury context

## Definition of Done
- Injury data is collected, processed, and available in the feature store
- ML models can access injury features for predictions
- UI displays relevant injury information for games
- LLM generates narratives that reference key injuries

## Related Features
- Data Source Integration Framework (dependency)
- Feature Engineering (will be enhanced)
- Predictions & Outputs (will be enhanced)
