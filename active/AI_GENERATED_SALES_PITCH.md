# User Story: AI-Generated Sales Pitch

## Overview
**As a** sports bettor  
**I want** natural language explanations for betting recommendations  
**So that** I can understand the reasoning behind predictions and make more informed decisions

## Value Proposition
Translates numerical predictions into persuasive reasoning that bettors can understand and trust. This increases user engagement and confidence in the system's recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System generates coherent narrative explanations for each game prediction
- Explanations incorporate relevant factors (injuries, odds movement, efficiency metrics)
- Content is persuasive and tailored to the specific betting market (moneyline, spread, over/under)
- Generated text is free of factual errors or contradictions

## Technical Requirements
- Implement LLM integration to convert prediction data into narrative text
- Create templates for different betting markets
- Develop a system to track which factors influenced each prediction
- Ensure generated content meets quality standards

## Implementation Plan
1. Design prompt templates for each market type
2. Implement API integration with a suitable LLM provider
3. Create a pipeline to convert prediction data into structured input for the LLM
4. Develop quality assurance checks for the generated content
5. Integrate with the existing prediction workflow

## Definition of Done
- For each game prediction, a coherent "pitch" is generated that explains the reasoning
- Pitches are specific to the game and betting market context
- System can handle all NFL games in a given week
- Content meets readability and quality standards
