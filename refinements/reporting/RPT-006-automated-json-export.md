# RPT-006: Automated JSON export for GitHub Pages dashboards

## User Story
**As a** plan_pipe user  
**I want** automated JSON export functionality that generates dashboard data files  
**So that** I can commit static dashboard data to project repositories for GitHub Pages consumption without exposing plan_pipe to the internet

## Value Proposition
Enables public dashboard visibility while keeping plan_pipe as a local development tool. Provides automated workflow for generating and updating dashboard data that can be safely committed to public repositories.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated JSON export command generates dashboard data for all projects
- [ ] Export includes essential metrics (story counts, epic progress, velocity trends)
- [ ] JSON files are generated in project-specific directory structure
- [ ] Export command can target specific projects or all projects
- [ ] Generated JSON includes metadata (last updated, data freshness indicators)
- [ ] Export process validates data integrity before writing files
- [ ] Command-line interface for manual export operations
- [ ] Scheduled export capability (daily, weekly, on-demand)
- [ ] Export includes project configuration and display settings
- [ ] Generated files are optimized for GitHub Pages static serving
- [ ] Error handling for failed exports with clear diagnostics
- [ ] Export process integrates with git workflow for automatic commits

## Technical Notes
- Generate JSON files in standardized format for dashboard consumption
- Include data validation to ensure export completeness
- Optimize file size while maintaining necessary detail
- Support incremental exports to avoid regenerating unchanged data
- Include timestamp and version information in exported data
- Design schema to be backwards compatible for dashboard evolution
- Consider compression for large datasets

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Export command tested with sample project data
- [ ] JSON schema documented for dashboard developers
- [ ] Export process performance tested with large datasets
- [ ] Integration tested with GitHub Pages dashboard template
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully with clear messaging
