# RPT-003: Dependency visualization and impact analysis

## User Story
**As a** planning agent or project manager  
**I want** dependency visualization and impact analysis for stories  
**So that** I can identify critical path dependencies and assess the impact of changes or delays

## Value Proposition
Provides visibility into story interdependencies and enables impact analysis for better risk management and strategic planning decisions when dependencies change.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GET /api/v1/reports/dependencies - Dependency graph data for visualization
- [ ] Critical path analysis identifying longest dependency chains
- [ ] Impact analysis showing downstream effects of story changes
- [ ] Dependency cycle detection and resolution recommendations
- [ ] Blocked story identification with root cause analysis
- [ ] Dependency strength analysis (direct vs indirect dependencies)
- [ ] Epic-level dependency mapping and visualization
- [ ] Risk assessment based on dependency complexity
- [ ] Timeline impact prediction for dependency changes
- [ ] Export dependency data in graph formats (GraphML, DOT)

## Technical Notes
- Implement graph algorithms for dependency analysis
- Use recursive queries for transitive dependency calculation
- Support multiple dependency types (blocks, depends on, relates to)
- Include graph traversal optimization for large dependency networks
- Provide different visualization layouts (hierarchical, force-directed)
- Consider using graph databases for complex dependency analysis

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Graph algorithms handle circular dependency detection
- [ ] Performance tests with complex dependency networks
- [ ] Critical path calculations verified with test scenarios
- [ ] API responses suitable for graph visualization libraries
- [ ] Impact analysis accuracy validated with sample data
