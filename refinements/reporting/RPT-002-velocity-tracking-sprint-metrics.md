# RPT-002: Velocity tracking and sprint metrics

## User Story
**As a** project manager or planning agent  
**I want** velocity tracking and sprint metrics for story completion  
**So that** I can accurately estimate future sprint capacity and track team performance trends

## Value Proposition
Enables data-driven sprint planning and capacity estimation by tracking historical velocity patterns and providing predictive insights for future planning cycles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GET /api/v1/reports/velocity - Sprint velocity metrics with historical trends
- [ ] Story point completion tracking by time period (weekly, monthly)
- [ ] Velocity trend analysis with moving averages
- [ ] Burndown chart data for active sprints
- [ ] Cycle time analysis (time from active to completed)
- [ ] Throughput metrics (stories completed per period)
- [ ] Velocity forecasting based on historical data
- [ ] Team/epic-specific velocity breakdowns
- [ ] Variance analysis for estimate accuracy
- [ ] Sprint capacity vs actual completion reporting

## Technical Notes
- Implement time-series analysis for velocity trends
- Use status transition history for accurate timeline calculations
- Include confidence intervals for velocity forecasting
- Support configurable sprint/iteration length definitions
- Calculate weighted velocity based on story complexity
- Provide statistical significance indicators for trends

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Velocity calculations verified against manual tracking
- [ ] Historical data analysis produces accurate trends
- [ ] Forecasting algorithms tested with sample data
- [ ] API responses include statistical confidence measures
- [ ] Performance optimized for multi-month historical analysis
