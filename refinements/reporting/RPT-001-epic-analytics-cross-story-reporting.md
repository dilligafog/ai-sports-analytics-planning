# RPT-001: Epic analytics and cross-story reporting

## User Story
**As a** planning agent or stakeholder  
**I want** comprehensive analytics and reporting across epics and stories  
**So that** I can track progress, identify bottlenecks, and make informed strategic planning decisions

## Value Proposition
Provides strategic insights into story portfolio health, epic progress, and cross-cutting patterns that support data-driven planning and resource allocation decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GET /api/v1/reports/epic-summary - Stories by epic and status with counts
- [ ] Epic completion percentages and progress tracking
- [ ] Story distribution analysis across priorities and estimates
- [ ] Cross-epic dependency analysis and impact assessment
- [ ] Timeline analysis showing epic velocity and completion trends
- [ ] Resource allocation reporting by epic and team
- [ ] Story aging analysis (time in each status)
- [ ] Epic health scoring based on completion rate and dependencies
- [ ] Comparative epic performance metrics
- [ ] Customizable date ranges for all analytics

## Technical Notes
- Leverage PostgreSQL analytical functions for complex queries
- Implement caching for expensive analytical queries
- Create materialized views for frequently accessed metrics
- Support real-time analytics with WebSocket updates
- Include data visualization recommendations in API responses
- Consider pre-computed metrics for common dashboard views

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Analytics endpoints return results within 2 seconds
- [ ] Unit tests cover all analytical calculations
- [ ] Data accuracy verified against manual calculations
- [ ] API documentation includes example responses and interpretations
- [ ] Performance tests with large story datasets
