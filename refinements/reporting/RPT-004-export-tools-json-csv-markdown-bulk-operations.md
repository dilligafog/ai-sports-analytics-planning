# RPT-004: Export tools (JSON, CSV, markdown bulk operations)

## User Story
**As a** stakeholder or external system integrator  
**I want** comprehensive export tools for stories in multiple formats  
**So that** I can create reports, backups, and integrate story data with external tools and systems

## Value Proposition
Enables data portability and integration with external reporting tools while providing backup capabilities and supporting various stakeholder reporting needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Export stories to JSON format with full metadata preservation
- [ ] Export stories to CSV format optimized for spreadsheet analysis
- [ ] Export epic collections as markdown file archives
- [ ] Custom field selection for targeted exports
- [ ] Template-based export formatting for consistent reports
- [ ] Scheduled export capabilities with automated delivery
- [ ] Export filtering by date ranges, status, and epic
- [ ] Compressed archive creation for large exports
- [ ] Export validation to ensure data integrity
- [ ] Progress tracking for large export operations

## Technical Notes
- Support streaming exports for large datasets to manage memory
- Implement configurable export templates for different use cases
- Include metadata preservation options for round-trip compatibility
- Provide format validation for all export types
- Consider implementing export scheduling with cron-like syntax
- Include export auditing and access logging

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Export formats validated with external tools (Excel, analysis software)
- [ ] Large dataset exports tested for memory efficiency
- [ ] Round-trip import/export tested for data integrity
- [ ] Export templates documented with examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for various export sizes
