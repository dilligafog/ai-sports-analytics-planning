# API-004: Bulk operations endpoints (import/export)

## User Story
**As a** system administrator or data analyst  
**I want** bulk import and export capabilities for stories  
**So that** I can efficiently migrate data, create backups, and perform batch operations on large sets of stories

## Value Proposition
Enables efficient data migration, backup/restore operations, and bulk story management, reducing time required for large-scale story operations and enabling integration with external systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] POST /api/v1/export/stories - Export stories to JSON or CSV format
- [ ] POST /api/v1/import/stories - Import stories from JSON or CSV
- [ ] GET /api/v1/export/markdown/{epic} - Export epic stories as markdown files
- [ ] Bulk validation during import with detailed error reporting
- [ ] Import conflict resolution (skip, overwrite, or merge options)
- [ ] Progress tracking for long-running bulk operations
- [ ] Asynchronous processing for large datasets
- [ ] Export filtering options (by epic, status, date range)
- [ ] Import preview mode to validate data before actual import
- [ ] Bulk status updates and field modifications

## Technical Notes
- Use asynchronous task queue (Celery) for large operations
- Implement streaming for large file exports to manage memory
- Include data validation and conflict detection during import
- Support multiple file formats with proper content-type detection
- Provide detailed operation logs and progress reporting
- Consider implementing resumable imports for large datasets

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Performance tests with large datasets (1000+ stories)
- [ ] Error handling and recovery for failed operations
- [ ] Import validation prevents data corruption
- [ ] Export formats properly formatted and parseable
- [ ] Async operation status can be monitored via API
