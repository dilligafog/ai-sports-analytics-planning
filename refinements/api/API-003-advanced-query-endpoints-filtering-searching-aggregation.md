# API-003: Advanced query endpoints (filtering, searching, aggregation)

## User Story
**As a** planning agent or stakeholder  
**I want** advanced query capabilities for stories including filtering, searching, and aggregation  
**So that** I can efficiently find specific stories and analyze patterns across the story portfolio

## Value Proposition
Enables sophisticated story analysis and reporting capabilities, allowing for complex queries that support strategic planning and portfolio management decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Advanced filtering by multiple criteria (epic, status, priority, estimates, dates)
- [ ] Full-text search across story titles, descriptions, and content
- [ ] Aggregation endpoints for story counts by epic, status, and priority
- [ ] Date range filtering for created, updated, and completion dates
- [ ] Dependency relationship queries (stories blocking/blocked by others)
- [ ] Tag-based filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Sorting options for all query results
- [ ] Pagination with cursor-based or offset-based options
- [ ] Query result caching for performance optimization
- [ ] Export query results in multiple formats (JSON, CSV)

## Technical Notes
- Leverage PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities
- Implement query builder pattern for complex filtering
- Use database indexes to optimize search performance
- Consider implementing query result caching with Redis
- Support for compound queries with AND/OR logic
- Include query execution time in response headers for monitoring

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Performance tests demonstrate sub-second query response times
- [ ] Unit tests cover all filtering and search combinations
- [ ] Complex query examples documented in API docs
- [ ] Search indexing strategy implemented and tested
- [ ] Query result pagination working efficiently
