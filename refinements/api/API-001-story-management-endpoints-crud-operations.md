# API-001: Story management endpoints (CRUD operations)

## User Story
**As a** developer or automation system  
**I want** REST API endpoints for story CRUD operations  
**So that** I can programmatically create, read, update, and delete stories without manual file manipulation

## Value Proposition
Enables automated story management workflows, CI/CD integration, and external tool development while maintaining data consistency and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GET /api/v1/stories - List stories with optional filtering (backlog, epic, status, priority)
- [ ] GET /api/v1/stories?backlog_id={id} - List stories in specific backlog
- [ ] POST /api/v1/stories - Create new story with validation (supports backlog assignment)
- [ ] GET /api/v1/stories/{id} - Get specific story details with backlog context
- [ ] PUT /api/v1/stories/{id} - Update existing story (can move between backlogs)
- [ ] POST /api/v1/stories/{id}/move - Move story to different backlog
- [ ] DELETE /api/v1/stories/{id} - Delete story (with safety checks)
- [ ] Request/response validation using Pydantic models
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes for all scenarios (200, 201, 400, 404, 422)
- [ ] Error responses include descriptive messages
- [ ] Pagination support for story listing
- [ ] Search capabilities by title, description, or content
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints

## Technical Notes
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Include proper input validation for all story fields including backlog_id
- Implement soft delete for stories to maintain audit trail
- Support story movement between backlogs with validation
- Include backlog context in story responses
- Implement proper foreign key constraints for backlog relationships

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests for all endpoints with various scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests with database operations
- [ ] API documentation automatically generated and accurate
- [ ] Performance tests for list operations with large datasets
- [ ] Error handling tested for all edge cases
