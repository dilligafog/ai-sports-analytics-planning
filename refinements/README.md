# Story Refinements

## Purpose

This folder contains stories that are being refined and developed from proposals before moving to the backlog. Stories here are in draft form and may undergo significant changes during the refinement process.

## Structure

Stories are organized by epic:
- `infrastructure/` - Core infrastructure and framework stories
- `api/` - API development and endpoint stories  
- `reporting/` - Analytics and reporting capability stories
- `integration/` - Integration and deployment stories

## Refinement Process

1. **Draft Creation**: Stories created from proposals with initial acceptance criteria
2. **Review & Refinement**: Stories reviewed for completeness, sizing, and dependencies
3. **Implementation Planning**: Complex stories get implementation plans created
4. **Ready for Backlog**: Refined stories moved to appropriate backlog epic folder

## Story Status

Stories in refinements are in `draft` status and will be moved to `backlog` status when ready for implementation.
