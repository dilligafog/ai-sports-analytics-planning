# INF-012: FastAPI service framework with basic CRUD endpoints

## User Story
**As a** developer working with story management  
**I want** a FastAPI service framework with basic CRUD operations for stories  
**So that** I can programmatically create, read, update, and delete stories through REST API endpoints

## Value Proposition
Provides the foundational API framework that enables programmatic story management, reducing manual file operations and enabling automation for story lifecycle management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FastAPI application framework set up with proper project structure
- [ ] Pydantic models defined for story data structure matching markdown frontmatter
- [ ] Basic CRUD endpoints implemented: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for stories
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation automatically generated and accessible
- [ ] Request/response validation using Pydantic models
- [ ] Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Health check endpoint for service monitoring
- [ ] Docker container configuration for the API service
- [ ] Environment-based configuration management
- [ ] Basic authentication middleware integrated

## Technical Notes
- FastAPI chosen for automatic OpenAPI docs, async support, and Pydantic integration
- Story data model should match existing YAML frontmatter structure
- Follow RESTful conventions for endpoint design
- Include request/response logging for debugging
- Error responses should include helpful messages for API consumers

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code implemented and tested with unit tests
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation accessible at /docs endpoint
- [ ] Docker container builds and runs successfully
- [ ] Integration tests for all CRUD operations pass
- [ ] Service can be deployed locally via Docker Compose
