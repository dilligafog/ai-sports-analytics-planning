# INF-013: SQLite database setup with multi-project story schema

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** an embedded SQLite database with a proper schema for multi-project story management  
**So that** the plan_pipe API service can store and query story data efficiently across multiple projects for reporting and analytics

## Value Proposition
Provides the persistent data layer required for advanced querying, reporting, and analytics capabilities across multiple projects while maintaining data integrity and performance in a multi-project environment using a lightweight, file-based database.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SQLite database file configured with proper initialization scripts
- [ ] Database schema includes projects table for multi-project support
- [ ] Database schema includes backlogs table for multi-backlog support within projects
- [ ] Stories table with project_id and backlog_id foreign key references
- [ ] story_dependencies table for managing story relationships (including cross-project)
- [ ] project_dependencies table for cross-project relationships
- [ ] project_members table for access control and team management
- [ ] status_history table for audit trail of status changes
- [ ] Database indexes optimized for common query patterns including multi-project queries
- [ ] Database migrations system set up for schema evolution
- [ ] Connection pooling configured for API service
- [ ] Database backup and restore procedures documented
- [ ] Environment variables for database configuration
- [ ] Health check queries for monitoring database status

## Technical Notes
- SQLite chosen for lightweight file-based storage with excellent JSON support and zero configuration
- Schema should support multi-project architecture with proper foreign key relationships
- Include proper foreign key constraints and data validation for project and backlog relationships
- Use database-level defaults where appropriate
- Implement efficient indexes for cross-project queries and dependency analysis
- Support git submodule integration through project metadata fields
- SQLite's WAL mode for better concurrent access in local development

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] SQLite database file created successfully with schema
- [ ] Schema migration scripts tested and documented
- [ ] Connection from API service verified
- [ ] Database performance benchmarked for expected load
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures tested
