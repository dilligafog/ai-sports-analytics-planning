# INF-013: Docker PostgreSQL database setup with story schema

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** a containerized PostgreSQL database with a proper schema for story management  
**So that** the API service can store and query story data efficiently for reporting and analytics

## Value Proposition
Provides the persistent data layer required for advanced querying, reporting, and analytics capabilities while maintaining data integrity and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL Docker container configured with proper initialization scripts
- [ ] Database schema includes stories table with all required fields
- [ ] story_dependencies table for managing story relationships
- [ ] status_history table for audit trail of status changes
- [ ] Database indexes optimized for common query patterns
- [ ] Database migrations system set up for schema evolution
- [ ] Connection pooling configured for API service
- [ ] Database backup and restore procedures documented
- [ ] Environment variables for database configuration
- [ ] Health check queries for monitoring database status

## Technical Notes
- PostgreSQL chosen for JSONB support for metadata and robust ACID compliance
- Schema should support both current story structure and future enhancements
- Consider partitioning for status_history table if high volume expected
- Include proper foreign key constraints and data validation
- Use database-level defaults where appropriate

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Database container starts successfully in Docker Compose
- [ ] Schema migration scripts tested and documented
- [ ] Connection from API service verified
- [ ] Database performance benchmarked for expected load
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures tested
