# INF-014: File system synchronization service

## User Story
**As a** stakeholder using the file-based workflow  
**I want** automatic two-way synchronization between database and markdown files  
**So that** I can continue using the folder structure while benefiting from API automation capabilities

## Value Proposition
Maintains the preferred folder-based organization while enabling database-driven features. Ensures data consistency between file system and database without requiring workflow changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File system watcher detects changes to markdown files in real-time
- [ ] Database changes automatically generate corresponding markdown file updates
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy handles simultaneous file/database changes
- [ ] Synchronization completes within 30 seconds for individual story changes
- [ ] Bulk operations efficiently synchronize multiple stories
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic for failed synchronization attempts
- [ ] Logging system tracks all synchronization events and conflicts
- [ ] Manual sync command available for troubleshooting
- [ ] Validation ensures data integrity during sync operations
- [ ] Service handles markdown frontmatter parsing and generation correctly

## Technical Notes
- Use Python's watchdog library for file system monitoring
- Implement event-driven architecture to minimize sync delays
- File system takes precedence in conflict resolution to preserve manual edits
- Consider using file modification timestamps for conflict detection
- Robust error handling for malformed markdown files
- Batch processing for initial synchronization of existing files

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Synchronization service runs as separate Docker container
- [ ] Unit tests cover all sync scenarios including edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests verify database-file consistency
- [ ] Performance tests confirm sync speed requirements
- [ ] Documentation includes troubleshooting guide for sync issues
