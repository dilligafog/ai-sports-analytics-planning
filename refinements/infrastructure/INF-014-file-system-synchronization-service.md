# INF-014: Multi-project file system synchronization service

## User Story
**As a** stakeholder using the file-based workflow across multiple projects  
**I want** automatic two-way synchronization between database and markdown files across all managed projects  
**So that** each project can continue using their preferred folder structure while benefiting from plan_pipe's API automation capabilities

## Value Proposition
Maintains each project's preferred folder-based organization while enabling cross-project database-driven features. Ensures data consistency between file systems and database across multiple project repositories without requiring workflow changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File system watcher detects changes to markdown files in real-time across all project submodules
- [ ] Database changes automatically generate corresponding markdown file updates with project context
- [ ] Git submodule integration manages multiple project planning repositories
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy handles simultaneous file/database changes across projects
- [ ] Synchronization completes within 30 seconds for individual story changes
- [ ] Bulk operations efficiently synchronize multiple stories across projects
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic for failed synchronization attempts
- [ ] Logging system tracks all synchronization events and conflicts with project information
- [ ] Manual sync command available for troubleshooting specific projects
- [ ] Validation ensures data integrity during sync operations across project boundaries
- [ ] Service handles markdown frontmatter parsing and generation correctly with project metadata
- [ ] Git submodule status monitoring and automatic updates when configured

## Technical Notes
- Use Python's watchdog library for file system monitoring
- Implement event-driven architecture to minimize sync delays
- File system takes precedence in conflict resolution to preserve manual edits
- Consider using file modification timestamps for conflict detection
- Robust error handling for malformed markdown files
- Batch processing for initial synchronization of existing files

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Synchronization service runs as separate Docker container
- [ ] Unit tests cover all sync scenarios including edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests verify database-file consistency
- [ ] Performance tests confirm sync speed requirements
- [ ] Documentation includes troubleshooting guide for sync issues
