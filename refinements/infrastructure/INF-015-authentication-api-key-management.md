# INF-015: Authentication and API key management

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** secure authentication and API key management for the story workflow API  
**So that** only authorized users and systems can access and modify story data

## Value Proposition
Provides essential security controls to protect story data and ensure only authorized access to API operations, enabling safe deployment in multi-user or external-facing environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API key generation and management system implemented
- [ ] Authentication middleware validates API keys on protected endpoints
- [ ] Different permission levels supported (read-only, read-write, admin)
- [ ] API key expiration and rotation capabilities
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints
- [ ] Audit logging of all authenticated API requests
- [ ] Secure storage of API keys with proper hashing
- [ ] CLI tool for API key management (create, list, revoke)
- [ ] Environment variable configuration for authentication settings
- [ ] Health check endpoints excluded from authentication requirements

## Technical Notes
- Use secure random generation for API keys
- Implement bearer token authentication pattern
- Consider JWT tokens for more complex permission scenarios
- Hash API keys in database storage (bcrypt or similar)
- Rate limiting should be configurable per API key
- Include request source identification in audit logs

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Authentication middleware integrated with FastAPI
- [ ] Unit tests cover all authentication scenarios
- [ ] Security review completed for authentication implementation
- [ ] API key management CLI tested and documented
- [ ] Rate limiting tested under load conditions
