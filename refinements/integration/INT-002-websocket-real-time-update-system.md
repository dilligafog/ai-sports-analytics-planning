# INT-002: WebSocket real-time update system

## User Story
**As a** stakeholder or team member  
**I want** real-time notifications for story status changes and updates  
**So that** I can stay informed about project progress without manually checking for updates

## Value Proposition
Enables real-time collaboration and immediate visibility into story changes, improving team coordination and reducing the need for manual status checking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket endpoint for real-time story update notifications
- [ ] Event-driven notifications for status transitions
- [ ] Story creation, update, and deletion notifications
- [ ] Subscription management for specific epics or stories
- [ ] User authentication for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Message queuing for offline clients
- [ ] Heartbeat mechanism for connection health monitoring
- [ ] Rate limiting for notification delivery
- [ ] Notification filtering and preferences
- [ ] Integration with file system sync events

## Technical Notes
- Use FastAPI WebSocket support with async/await patterns
- Implement message broker (Redis) for scalable real-time messaging
- Include connection management for multiple concurrent clients
- Provide JSON-based message format with event types
- Consider implementing connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios
- Include graceful degradation when WebSocket unavailable

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable under load testing
- [ ] Message delivery guaranteed for active connections
- [ ] Authentication and authorization working for WebSocket endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests verify real-time notification delivery
- [ ] Client-side connection handling documented with examples
