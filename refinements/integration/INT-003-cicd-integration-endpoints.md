# INT-003: CI/CD integration endpoints

## User Story
**As a** developer or CI/CD system  
**I want** API endpoints designed for CI/CD integration and automation  
**So that** story management can be automated as part of development workflows and deployment pipelines

## Value Proposition
Enables automated story management within development workflows, allowing for seamless integration between code development and story tracking without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Webhook endpoints for GitHub/GitLab integration
- [ ] Story status update endpoints triggered by CI/CD events
- [ ] Automated story creation from commit messages or PR descriptions
- [ ] Integration with deployment pipelines for story completion
- [ ] Branch-to-story linking and automated updates
- [ ] CI/CD-specific authentication and authorization
- [ ] Batch operations optimized for automation workflows
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic for CI/CD failures
- [ ] Audit logging for all automated story operations
- [ ] Documentation and examples for common CI/CD platforms

## Technical Notes
- Implement idempotent operations for CI/CD reliability
- Support for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins integration patterns
- Include webhook validation and security measures
- Provide flexible mapping between CI/CD events and story actions
- Consider rate limiting for automated operations
- Include rollback capabilities for failed automated updates

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Integration tested with GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Webhook security and validation implemented
- [ ] CI/CD automation examples documented and tested
- [ ] Error handling robust for network failures and retries
- [ ] Performance tested under high-frequency CI/CD events
