# INT-001: Docker compose production configuration

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** production-ready Docker Compose configuration for the story workflow API  
**So that** I can deploy and manage the complete system stack in production environments

## Value Proposition
Provides production-ready deployment configuration that ensures reliability, security, and scalability for the story workflow management system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration for all services (API, database, sync, nginx)
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Nginx reverse proxy configuration with SSL termination
- [ ] Database persistence and backup volume configuration
- [ ] Service health checks and restart policies
- [ ] Resource limits and performance optimization
- [ ] Logging configuration with log rotation
- [ ] Security hardening (non-root users, minimal images)
- [ ] Secrets management for production credentials
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics collection setup

## Technical Notes
- Use multi-stage Docker builds for optimized production images
- Implement proper security practices (least privilege, secrets management)
- Include database connection pooling and optimization
- Configure proper logging levels and log aggregation
- Set up health checks for all services
- Use official base images with security updates

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Production deployment tested in staging environment
- [ ] Security review completed for all configurations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet production requirements
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured and tested
