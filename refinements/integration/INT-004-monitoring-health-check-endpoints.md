# INT-004: Monitoring and health check endpoints

## User Story
**As a** system administrator or DevOps engineer  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring and health check endpoints for the story workflow API  
**So that** I can monitor system health, diagnose issues, and ensure reliable service operation

## Value Proposition
Provides essential observability and monitoring capabilities for production operations, enabling proactive issue detection and system reliability assurance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GET /health - Basic service health check endpoint
- [ ] GET /health/detailed - Comprehensive health status with dependencies
- [ ] Database connection health monitoring
- [ ] File system sync service health monitoring
- [ ] API performance metrics endpoint
- [ ] System resource utilization metrics
- [ ] Custom metrics for story operations (creation rate, transition frequency)
- [ ] Integration with monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
- [ ] Alerting configuration for critical service failures
- [ ] Health check endpoint timeouts and circuit breaker patterns

## Technical Notes
- Implement health checks that don't impact performance
- Include dependency health validation (database, external services)
- Provide metrics in Prometheus format for easy integration
- Use structured logging for monitoring and debugging
- Include service version and build information in health responses
- Consider implementing readiness vs liveness health checks

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Health checks respond within 1 second under normal load
- [ ] Monitoring integration tested with sample monitoring stack
- [ ] Alert conditions tested and validated
- [ ] Health check reliability tested under failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation includes monitoring setup and alert configurations
