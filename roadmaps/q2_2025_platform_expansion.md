# Q2 2025 Roadmap: Advanced Features & Platform Expansion

**Planning Period**: April - June 2025  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: Draft

## Strategic Objectives

Building on Q1 foundation to expand feature richness and platform capabilities:

### 1. Enhanced Prediction Signals (P1)
**Goal**: Incorporate additional data sources for competitive advantage

#### Major Features
- **Weather Data Integration**
  - Stories: WEATHER_DATA_INTEGRATION
  - Impact: Weather conditions significantly affect outdoor games
  - Deliverable: Game-specific weather factor integration

- **Public Betting Trends Analysis**
  - Stories: PUBLIC_BETTING_DATA_INTEGRATION
  - Impact: Market sentiment and sharp vs. public money analysis
  - Deliverable: Betting trend signals in predictions

- **Kaggle Dataset Utilization**
  - Stories: KAGGLE_DATA_UTILIZATION
  - Impact: Historical patterns and advanced analytics
  - Deliverable: Enhanced feature engineering from public datasets

### 2. Social Media Intelligence (P1)
**Goal**: Real-time sentiment and news analysis for prediction enhancement

#### Major Features
- **Social Media Integration Phase 1**
  - Stories: S01-S06 (Schema, X/Twitter ingestion, relevance filtering)
  - Impact: Real-time social sentiment and breaking news
  - Deliverable: Social signals feeding into prediction models

- **Cross-Platform Social Analysis**
  - Stories: S04-S05 (Bluesky integration and keyword search)
  - Impact: Broader social media coverage beyond Twitter/X
  - Deliverable: Multi-platform social sentiment analysis

### 3. Historical Analysis & ROI (P2)
**Goal**: Provide evidence of system performance and enable strategy optimization

#### Major Features
- **Backtesting & ROI Tracking**
  - Stories: BACKTESTING_ROI_TRACKING
  - Impact: Historical performance validation and strategy refinement
  - Deliverable: ROI metrics and historical accuracy reporting

- **LLM Evaluation & Modeling Lift**
  - Stories: EVAL-001, MOD-001-003 from LLM backlog
  - Impact: Measure LLM signal contribution to prediction accuracy
  - Deliverable: A/B testing framework for LLM features

## Milestones

### Month 1 (April)
- [ ] Weather data pipeline established
- [ ] Social media schema and ingestion framework (S01-S02)
- [ ] Backtesting infrastructure setup

### Month 2 (May)
- [ ] Public betting trends integration
- [ ] Social media relevance filtering and entity linking (S03-S06)
- [ ] LLM evaluation harness implementation

### Month 3 (June)
- [ ] Kaggle dataset integration
- [ ] Cross-platform social analysis (Bluesky integration)
- [ ] ROI tracking dashboard and historical performance analysis

## Success Metrics
- **Data Richness**: 5+ additional data sources integrated
- **Social Coverage**: Real-time analysis across Twitter/X and Bluesky
- **Historical Validation**: Backtesting across 2+ NFL seasons
- **Performance Measurement**: LLM contribution quantified

## Platform Scaling Considerations
- **Data Volume**: Social media streams require significant processing capacity
- **API Rate Limits**: Twitter/X and Bluesky API usage optimization
- **Storage Requirements**: Historical data for backtesting analysis

## Dependencies from Q1
- [ ] Gold feature store operational (foundation for new data sources)
- [ ] LLM pipeline established (prerequisite for social analysis)
- [ ] Model evaluation framework (needed for backtesting accuracy)
