# Scripts Directory

Automation scripts for maintaining the planning repository.

## ðŸ“‹ Current Workflow

Stories are managed through JSON-based status updates. Files stay in their original `backlog/` subdirectories and status changes happen through `PRIORITIZATION.json` updates. **No file moving is required.**

## Prerequisites

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

## âœ… Active Scripts

- **Include error handling**: Gracefully handle missing files or invalid data
- **Log meaningful output**: Help users understand what happened
- **Follow naming conventions**: Use snake_case and descriptive names

## Adding New Scripts

1. Create the script in this directory
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x script_name.py`
3. Add usage documentation to this README
4. Test thoroughly with various repository states
5. Consider integration with CI/CD if appropriate
