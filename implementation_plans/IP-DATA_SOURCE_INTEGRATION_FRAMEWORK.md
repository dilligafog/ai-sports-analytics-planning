# DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK Implementation Plan - Data Source Integration Framework

## Overview

- **Epic**: infra
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 story points
- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks with 3 phases
- **Priority**: Medium

## Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Plugin-based architecture with abstract interfaces, standardized data validation pipeline, and automated integration testing
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Python abstract base classes for data source interfaces
  - Pydantic for schema validation and data modeling
  - Apache Airflow for orchestration and scheduling
  - Pytest for automated testing framework
  - Docker for containerized data source integration
- **Integration Points**:
  - ML pipelines (feature engineering)
  - LLM training data preparation
  - UI data visualization components
  - Configuration system (INF-001)
- **Data Flow**: Raw data sources → Validation layer → Transformation pipeline → Standardized storage → Consumer applications

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework Architecture
**Deliverables:**
- Abstract base classes for data source integration
- Schema validation framework with Pydantic
- Plugin discovery and registration system
- Basic documentation templates

**Story Points**: 3
**Dependencies**: None (foundational)
**Technical Tasks:**
- Define `DataSource` abstract base class with required methods
- Create `DataValidator` interface for schema enforcement
- Implement plugin discovery system using Python entry points
- Design configuration schema for data source definitions
- Create basic integration test framework structure

### Phase 2: Data Quality & Transformation Pipeline
**Deliverables:**
- Automated data quality validation
- Standardized data transformation pipeline
- Metadata generation and tracking
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Story Points**: 3
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion
**Technical Tasks:**
- Implement data quality checks (completeness, consistency, accuracy)
- Create transformation pipeline with configurable steps
- Build metadata tracking system for data lineage
- Implement robust error handling and retry logic
- Create data quality monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Integration Testing & Documentation
**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive testing framework for data sources
- Integration with ML/LLM/UI pipelines
- Documentation and examples for new data sources
- Performance optimization and monitoring

**Story Points**: 2
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion, basic ML/LLM pipelines
**Technical Tasks:**
- Build automated integration tests for all consumer systems
- Create comprehensive documentation with examples
- Implement performance monitoring and optimization
- Develop troubleshooting guides and best practices
- Create sample data source implementations

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Pattern Decision
**Choice**: Plugin-based architecture with abstract interfaces
**Rationale**:
- Enables adding new data sources without modifying core code
- Provides clear separation of concerns
- Allows for independent testing and deployment of data sources
**Alternatives Considered**: Microservices approach (too complex for initial implementation), monolithic approach (not scalable)

### Schema Validation Decision
**Choice**: Pydantic for data validation and modeling
**Rationale**:
- Strong typing support with Python type hints
- Automatic validation and serialization
- Good integration with FastAPI and other Python frameworks
- Clear error messages for debugging
**Alternatives Considered**: Marshmallow (less type safety), custom validation (reinventing the wheel)

### Testing Strategy Decision
**Choice**: Automated integration testing with mock data
**Rationale**:
- Ensures data sources work with all consumer systems
- Catches integration issues early in development
- Provides confidence for production deployments
**Alternatives Considered**: Manual testing (not scalable), unit tests only (insufficient coverage)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Performance Bottlenecks with Multiple Data Sources
**Impact**: High - System slowdown affects all consumers
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Implement parallel processing for independent data sources
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Monitor performance metrics and set alerts
- Design graceful degradation for slow data sources

### Risk: Schema Evolution Breaking Existing Integrations
**Impact**: Medium - Existing consumers may fail
**Likelihood**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Implement schema versioning with backward compatibility
- Create migration tools for schema changes
- Comprehensive testing before schema updates
- Rollback procedures for failed schema migrations

### Risk: Data Quality Issues Propagating to Consumers
**Impact**: High - Poor predictions and user experience
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict data quality gates
- Create data quality monitoring dashboards
- Automated alerts for quality threshold violations
- Circuit breaker pattern for problematic data sources

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- New data sources can be added using only configuration and plugin implementation
- All data sources automatically integrate with ML, LLM, and UI pipelines
- Data quality validation catches common issues before propagation
- Framework supports different data types (structured, unstructured, streaming)

### Non-functional Requirements
- Data processing latency < 5 minutes for batch sources
- Framework supports concurrent processing of 10+ data sources
- System availability 99.5% excluding planned maintenance
- Memory usage scales linearly with number of data sources

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all framework components (95% coverage)
- Integration tests for sample data source implementations
- Performance tests with realistic data volumes
- End-to-end tests validating consumer integration

## Follow-up Work

### Immediate Follow-ups (Next Sprint)
- Real-time streaming data source support
- Data source health monitoring dashboard
- Automated data source discovery for common APIs

### Technical Debt Considerations
- Monitor framework performance as data sources scale
- Regular review of data quality thresholds and rules
- Optimization of transformation pipeline performance

### Future Enhancements
- AI-powered data quality anomaly detection
- Automatic schema inference for new data sources
- Data lineage visualization and tracking
- Self-healing data pipelines with automatic retry and recovery

## Sample Implementation Structure

```python

        """Collect raw data from source"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def validate(self, data: List[Dict]) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate data quality and schema"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def transform(self, data: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
        """Transform to standardized format"""
        pass
