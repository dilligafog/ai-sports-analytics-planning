# INF-014 Implementation Plan - File system synchronization service

## Overview
- **Story Reference**: [INF-014](../refinements/infrastructure/INF-014-file-system-synchronization-service.md)
- **Epic**: infrastructure
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 story points
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks with 3 phases
- **Priority**: High

## Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Event-driven bidirectional synchronization between file system and SQLite database with multi-backlog support
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Python watchdog for file system monitoring across backlog directories
  - SQLite with JSON support for metadata storage including backlog relationships
  - SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations with backlog joins
  - asyncio for concurrent processing across multiple backlogs
  - APScheduler for periodic sync jobs with backlog segmentation
  - PyYAML for frontmatter parsing with backlog metadata
- **Integration Points**:
  - Story management API (INF-012) with multi-backlog endpoints
  - SQLite database (INF-013) with backlog schema
  - Markdown file structure in refinements/, backlog/, active/, completed/ with backlog organization
- **Data Flow**: File changes → Event queue → Database sync with backlog context ← API changes → File generation with backlog metadata

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Synchronization Framework
**Deliverables:**
- File system event monitoring with watchdog across backlog directories
- Database models and ORM setup with backlog relationships
- Basic file-to-database sync capability with backlog context
- Markdown frontmatter parser with YAML validation including backlog metadata
- Initial conflict detection logic for cross-backlog operations

**Story Points**: 3
**Dependencies**: INF-013 (database setup with multi-backlog schema completed)
**Technical Tasks:**
- Set up watchdog file system observer for story directories organized by backlog
- Implement database models matching story structure with backlog foreign keys
- Create markdown parser for YAML frontmatter extraction including backlog_id
- Build basic sync engine for file → database direction with backlog validation
- Implement file validation and error handling for multi-backlog scenarios
- Add logging and event tracking for sync operations with backlog context

### Phase 2: Bidirectional Sync and Conflict Resolution
**Deliverables:**
- Database-to-file synchronization capability
- Conflict resolution strategy implementation
- Batch synchronization for initial data loading
- Performance optimization for large file sets
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

**Story Points**: 3
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion
**Technical Tasks:**
- Implement database change detection and file generation
- Build conflict resolution logic (file system wins)
- Create batch sync process for initial repository sync
- Add timestamp-based conflict detection
- Implement retry logic for failed sync operations
- Optimize file I/O operations for performance

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Production Readiness
**Deliverables:**
- Real-time sync monitoring and metrics
- Manual sync triggers and administrative tools
- Integration with API service for change notifications
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Production deployment configuration

**Story Points**: 2
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion, INF-012 (API service)
**Technical Tasks:**
- Add sync metrics and monitoring endpoints
- Create CLI tools for manual sync operations
- Integrate with API service for change notifications
- Implement comprehensive error recovery procedures
- Add production logging and monitoring
- Create deployment scripts and configuration

## Technical Decisions

### File System Monitoring Strategy
**Choice**: Python watchdog with recursive directory monitoring
**Rationale**:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Efficient event-based monitoring vs polling
- Mature library with good performance characteristics
**Alternatives Considered**: Polling (inefficient), inotify (Linux-only), Windows APIs (platform-specific)

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
**Choice**: File system takes precedence over database
**Rationale**:
- Preserves stakeholder preference for file-based workflow
- Manual edits should always be respected
- Database serves as acceleration layer, not source of truth
**Alternatives Considered**: Last-write-wins (confusing), merge strategies (complex), database precedence (breaks workflow)

### Synchronization Timing
**Choice**: Real-time for individual changes, batched for bulk operations
**Rationale**:
- Immediate feedback for single story changes
- Efficient handling of bulk operations and imports
- Prevents sync storms during large updates
**Alternatives Considered**: Purely real-time (performance issues), purely batched (poor UX), polling-based (resource intensive)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: File System Permission Issues
**Impact**: High - Sync service cannot read/write files
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Run sync service with appropriate file permissions
- Include permission checking in health monitoring
- Provide clear error messages for permission failures
- Document required file system permissions

### Risk: Database Connection Failures
**Impact**: High - Sync operations fail completely
**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Implement connection pooling and retry logic
- Queue sync operations during database outages
- Include database health checks in monitoring
- Provide manual sync recovery procedures

### Risk: Sync Performance Degradation
**Impact**: Medium - Slow sync affects user experience
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Implement efficient file filtering (ignore non-story files)
- Use database transactions for batch operations
- Monitor sync performance and add alerting
- Optimize file I/O with async operations

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- File changes reflected in database within 30 seconds
- Database changes generate corresponding markdown files
- Conflict resolution preserves manual file edits
- Batch sync processes complete without data loss
- Error recovery maintains data consistency

### Non-functional Requirements
- Sync service handles 1000+ stories without performance degradation
- Memory usage remains stable during continuous operation
- File system monitoring has minimal CPU overhead
- Error conditions logged with sufficient detail for debugging

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all sync components (parser, conflict resolution, file I/O)
- Integration tests with real file system and database
- Performance tests with large story collections
- Failure scenario tests (database down, file permission issues)
- End-to-end tests with API service integration

## Follow-up Work

### Immediate Follow-ups (Next Sprint)
- Performance monitoring dashboards
- Sync operation audit trail
- Advanced conflict resolution options

### Technical Debt Considerations
- Regular review of sync performance metrics
- File system monitoring efficiency optimization
- Database query optimization for large datasets

### Future Enhancements
- Incremental sync for very large repositories
- Multiple repository synchronization support
- Real-time collaborative editing conflict resolution
- Sync operation scheduling and throttling
