# API-003 Implementation Plan - Advanced query endpoints (filtering, searching, aggregation)

## Overview
- **Story Reference**: [API-003](../refinements/api/API-003-advanced-query-endpoints-filtering-searching-aggregation.md)
- **Epic**: api
- **Estimated Effort**: 6 story points
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks with 2 phases
- **Priority**: Medium

## Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: PostgreSQL-powered advanced querying with full-text search, multi-backlog support, and aggregation capabilities
- **Technology Stack**:
  - FastAPI with advanced query parameter handling for multi-backlog filtering
  - PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexes optimized for cross-backlog queries
  - SQLAlchemy with complex query building supporting backlog joins
  - Pydantic models for query validation including backlog parameters
  - Redis for query result caching with backlog-aware cache keys
  - Elasticsearch (optional) for advanced search features across multiple backlogs
- **Integration Points**:
  - Story management endpoints (API-001) with multi-backlog support
  - PostgreSQL database with search indexes optimized for backlog queries
  - Caching layer for performance optimization with backlog segmentation
- **Data Flow**: Query parameters → Validation → Query builder → Database joins → Caching → Response formatting

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Filtering and Search Foundation
**Deliverables:**
- Advanced filtering query parameter system with multi-backlog support
- PostgreSQL full-text search implementation across backlogs
- Database indexes for query optimization including backlog joins
- Query builder with complex filter combinations and backlog filtering
- Basic caching for frequently accessed queries with backlog segmentation

**Story Points**: 3.5
**Dependencies**: API-001 (basic story endpoints with multi-backlog support)
**Technical Tasks:**
- Design flexible query parameter schema with Pydantic including backlog filtering
- Implement PostgreSQL full-text search with tsvector columns optimized for multi-backlog queries
- Create database indexes for common filter fields including backlog relationships
- Build dynamic query constructor for multiple filter combinations across backlogs
- Add basic Redis caching for search results with backlog-aware cache invalidation
- Implement pagination with cursor-based and offset options for large multi-backlog result sets

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics and Performance Optimization
**Deliverables:**
- Aggregation endpoints with grouping capabilities including multi-backlog analytics
- Date range filtering and temporal queries across backlogs
- Cross-backlog dependency relationship queries
- Performance optimization and advanced caching with backlog segmentation
- Export capabilities for query results with backlog filtering

**Story Points**: 2.5
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion
**Technical Tasks:**
- Implement aggregation queries with GROUP BY and statistical functions across backlogs
- Add date range filtering with timezone support for multi-backlog analysis
- Build recursive dependency relationship queries spanning multiple backlogs
- Optimize query performance with explain analysis for complex backlog joins
- Implement advanced caching strategies with cache invalidation based on backlog changes
- Add query result export in JSON and CSV formats with backlog metadata

## Technical Decisions

### Search Technology Choice
**Choice**: PostgreSQL full-text search with optional Elasticsearch integration
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL FTS sufficient for current scale and requirements
- Avoids additional infrastructure complexity
- Elasticsearch as future enhancement for advanced features
**Alternatives Considered**: Elasticsearch (overkill for current scale), Simple LIKE queries (poor performance), Apache Solr (additional complexity)

### Query Parameter Design
**Choice**: Flexible query parameter system with nested filtering
**Rationale**:
- Supports complex queries without overly complex URL structure
- Extensible for future filtering requirements
- Clear separation of concerns between validation and query building
**Alternatives Considered**: GraphQL (different paradigm), SQL-like query language (security concerns), Fixed filter endpoints (inflexible)

### Caching Strategy
**Choice**: Redis with intelligent cache invalidation
**Rationale**:
- Significant performance improvement for repeated queries
- Flexible TTL and invalidation strategies
- Supports complex data structures for different query types
**Alternatives Considered**: In-memory caching (not scalable), No caching (poor performance), Database query caching (limited flexibility)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Query Performance Degradation
**Impact**: High - Slow queries affect user experience
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive database indexing strategy
- Query performance monitoring and optimization
- Query complexity limits and timeouts
- Aggressive caching for expensive operations

### Risk: Complex Query Security Issues
**Impact**: High - SQL injection or data exposure
**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM for query construction
- Strict input validation with Pydantic
- Query parameter sanitization
- Access control validation for all queries

### Risk: Cache Invalidation Complexity
**Impact**: Medium - Stale data in query results
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Clear cache invalidation strategy based on story changes
- TTL-based cache expiration as backup
- Cache versioning for major data structure changes
- Manual cache clearing capabilities

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Support for filtering by all story fields (epic, status, priority, dates)
- Full-text search across story content with relevance ranking
- Aggregation queries return accurate counts and statistics
- Date range queries handle timezone considerations correctly
- Dependency queries return complete relationship graphs

### Non-functional Requirements
- Query response times under 2 seconds for complex searches
- Search results paginated efficiently for large datasets
- Cache hit ratio above 70% for repeated queries
- Memory usage stable during high query volume

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for query builder with various filter combinations
- Performance tests with large datasets (10,000+ stories)
- Search relevance tests with sample story content
- Cache effectiveness tests with realistic query patterns
- Integration tests with various client query scenarios

## Query Examples

### Advanced Filtering
```http
GET /api/v1/stories?epic=infrastructure&status=active,completed&priority=high&created_after=2025-01-01&estimate_range=3-8&tags=api,security
```

### Full-Text Search
```http
GET /api/v1/stories/search?q=docker+api&fields=title,content&limit=20&offset=0
```

### Aggregation Queries
```http
GET /api/v1/stories/aggregate?group_by=epic,status&metrics=count,avg_estimate&date_range=last_30_days
```

### Dependency Queries
```http
GET /api/v1/stories/dependencies?story_id=INF-014&depth=3&direction=both
```

## Database Schema Enhancements

```sql
-- Full-text search columns
ALTER TABLE stories ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;
CREATE INDEX stories_search_idx ON stories USING GIN(search_vector);

-- Optimized indexes for filtering
CREATE INDEX stories_epic_status_idx ON stories(epic, status);
CREATE INDEX stories_priority_created_idx ON stories(priority, created_date);
CREATE INDEX stories_estimate_idx ON stories USING BTREE((metadata->>'estimate'));

-- Update trigger for search vector
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_story_search_vector()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.search_vector := to_tsvector('english', 
        COALESCE(NEW.title, '') || ' ' || 
        COALESCE(NEW.metadata->>'content', ''));
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_story_search_trigger
    BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON stories
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_story_search_vector();
```
