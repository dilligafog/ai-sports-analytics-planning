# MODEL_TRAINING_EVALUATION Implementation Plan - Model Training & Evaluation

## Overview
- **Story Reference**: [MODEL_TRAINING_EVALUATION](../backlog/models/MODEL_TRAINING_EVALUATION.md)
- **Epic**: training
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 story points
- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks with 3 phases
- **Priority**: High

## Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Model training pipeline with MLflow tracking, automated evaluation framework, and versioned model storage
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - Python/scikit-learn/XGBoost for ML algorithms
  - MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
  - DVC for data versioning and pipeline orchestration
  - Docker for training environment reproducibility
  - Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Gold Feature Store (data input)
  - Configuration system (INF-001 dependency)
  - Model serving infrastructure (future)
- **Data Flow**: Gold features → Training pipeline → Model artifacts → Evaluation metrics → Model registry

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Training Infrastructure & CLI Foundation
**Deliverables:**
- `busta train` CLI command implementation
- Basic model training pipeline structure
- MLflow experiment tracking setup
- Model storage and versioning system

**Story Points**: 3
**Dependencies**: Gold Feature Store availability
**Technical Tasks:**
- Implement CLI command parsing for `busta train <market>`
- Set up MLflow tracking server and model registry
- Create base model trainer classes for different markets
- Implement model storage with metadata (version, hyperparameters, training date)
- Basic Docker containerization for training environments

### Phase 2: Market-Specific Models & Algorithms
**Deliverables:**
- Moneyline prediction models
- Against-the-spread (ATS) models  
- Over/under total prediction models
- Hyperparameter optimization framework

**Story Points**: 3
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion
**Technical Tasks:**
- Implement specific algorithms for each betting market
- Create hyperparameter tuning pipelines (GridSearch/RandomSearch/Optuna)
- Develop feature selection and engineering specific to each market
- Cross-validation framework implementation
- Baseline model implementations for comparison

### Phase 3: Evaluation Framework & Reporting
**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics (accuracy, AUC, betting ROI)
- Model performance reports and visualization
- Automated model validation pipeline
- Documentation and user guides

**Story Points**: 2
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion, trained models
**Technical Tasks:**
- Implement evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC
- Calculate betting-specific metrics: ROI, Kelly criterion, unit profit
- Create performance visualization dashboards
- Automated model validation against baseline strategies
- Generate model performance documentation

## Technical Decisions

### Model Architecture Decision
**Choice**: Ensemble approach with XGBoost + Linear models per market
**Rationale**: 
- XGBoost handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions well
- Linear models provide interpretability for betting decisions
- Ensemble reduces overfitting and improves generalization
**Alternatives Considered**: Deep learning models (rejected due to data size and interpretability requirements)

### Training Infrastructure Decision
**Choice**: MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard with good Python integration
- Built-in model versioning and metadata tracking
- Easy integration with existing ML workflows
**Alternatives Considered**: Weights & Biases (more expensive), custom solution (too much overhead)

### Feature Engineering Decision
**Choice**: Market-specific feature engineering pipelines
**Rationale**:
- Different betting markets have different predictive signals
- Allows for specialized features (e.g., defensive stats for under/over)
- Enables market-specific hyperparameter optimization

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Insufficient Historical Data
**Impact**: High - Models may not generalize well
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement data augmentation strategies
- Use transfer learning from related sports
- Start with simpler models and increase complexity gradually

### Risk: Overfitting to Historical Patterns
**Impact**: High - Poor performance on future games
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Rigorous cross-validation with temporal splits
- Implement walk-forward validation
- Monitor model performance degradation over time

### Risk: Feature Store Dependencies
**Impact**: Medium - Training pipeline blocked
**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Create mock feature store for development
- Implement graceful degradation for missing features
- Parallel development with feature store team

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- `busta train <market>` command successfully trains models
- Models achieve better performance than baseline strategies
- Training process is reproducible across environments
- Model artifacts are properly versioned and stored

### Non-functional Requirements
- Training completes within 2 hours for full dataset
- Model inference time < 100ms per prediction
- Training pipeline has 99% reliability
- Memory usage < 8GB during training

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all model components (90% coverage)
- Integration tests for full training pipeline
- Performance benchmarks against historical data
- End-to-end testing with mock betting scenarios

## Follow-up Work

### Immediate Follow-ups (Next Sprint)
- Model serving infrastructure for real-time predictions
- A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Automated retraining pipeline based on data drift

### Technical Debt Considerations
- Monitor model performance degradation over time
- Implement automated feature importance tracking
- Create model interpretability tools for betting insights

### Future Enhancements
- Real-time model updates during games
- Integration with live betting strategies
- Advanced ensemble methods (stacking, blending)
