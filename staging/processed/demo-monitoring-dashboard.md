# Real-time Performance Monitoring Dashboard

## User Story

**As a** sports analytics platform administrator  
**I want** a real-time dashboard showing system performance and health metrics  
**So that** I can quickly identify and respond to issues before they impact users

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Display live model accuracy metrics for active predictions
- [ ] Show data ingestion pipeline status and lag times
- [ ] Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Alert on performance degradation or failures
- [ ] Allow drill-down into specific metrics and time ranges
- [ ] Update metrics in real-time (< 30 second refresh)

## Description

The monitoring dashboard will provide a centralized view of platform health and performance. It should aggregate metrics from various sources including:

- Model prediction services
- Data ingestion pipelines
- Database performance
- API response times
- User activity levels

The dashboard should be accessible to administrators and provide both high-level overview and detailed diagnostic information.

## Implementation Notes

- Consider using WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Integrate with existing logging and metrics collection systems
- Design for mobile responsiveness
- Implement proper authentication and role-based access

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Dashboard displays all required metrics in real-time
- [ ] Performance tests show minimal impact on system resources
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design implemented
- [ ] Unit and integration tests written
- [ ] Documentation updated with configuration and usage instructions
- [ ] Security review completed for admin access controls
