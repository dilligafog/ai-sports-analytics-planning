# CCU-002: Add Critical Path Tests for Config Migration

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: CCU-002
**Epic**: Code Clean Up - Testing Implementation
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Effort**: Small (1-2 days)
**Type**: Implementation
**Status**: Ready

## Background
Following the human decision in HUM-CDR-014, we need to add critical path tests only (not comprehensive coverage). Focus on the highest risk areas identified in CDR-005 findings, specifically config migration files.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Config loading/validation tests for migrated files
- [ ] Import compatibility tests between config systems
- [ ] Basic smoke tests for critical migration paths
- [ ] Tests focused on 26 config migration files (highest risk)
- [ ] Test failures provide clear error context
- [ ] Tests integrate with existing test infrastructure

## Implementation Details

### Testing Scope (Based on CDR-005 Analysis)
```bash
# Focus areas:
# 1. Config migration (26 files) - HIGH risk
# 2. Import compatibility between V1/V2 systems
# 3. Basic smoke tests for critical paths
```

### Test Categories
- **Config Loading Tests**: Validate config objects load correctly
- **Import Compatibility Tests**: Ensure V1/V2 compatibility patterns work
- **Path Resolution Tests**: Validate pathlib.Path vs string path handling
- **Attribute Access Tests**: Test nested vs flat configuration access

### Test Structure
```python
# Example test pattern
def test_config_migration_compatibility():
    """Test that migrated config maintains compatibility."""
    # Test V1 â†’ V2 migration preserves expected attributes
    # Test path handling differences
    # Test nested vs flat access patterns
```

## Technical Details
- Use existing pytest infrastructure
- Follow established testing patterns from coding standards
- Focus on validation rather than comprehensive coverage
- Tests should be fast and reliable for CI integration

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Only adds tests, doesn't change production code
- **Focused Scope**: Only critical paths per HUM-CDR-014 decision
- **Incremental**: Can add more tests later if needed</content>
