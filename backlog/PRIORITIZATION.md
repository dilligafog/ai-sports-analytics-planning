- **User experience**: Better presentation of our accurate predictions  
- **Advanced features**: Regime change detection and real-time adjustments

## Implementation Strategy

### Next 2 Weeks (Sprint Focus)
1. **ADH-015**: Quick win - utilize existing Kaggle data we already have
2. **LLM-001**: High-value news signal extraction implementation
3. **MOD-001**: Establish strong model baselines for reliable predictions

### Month 1 Priority  
4. **LLM-002**: Make predictions explainable and trustworthy
5. **MOD-002**: Integrate all signals with intelligent stacking
6. **MOD-003**: Ensure prediction probabilities are properly calibrated

### Key Dependencies
