- **Immediate impact**: News analysis and injury data are proven prediction enhancers

### Tier 2: Competitive Edge (Priority 6-10)  
- **User engagement**: AI explanations make our picks more compelling
- **Market advantage**: Contrarian betting strategies and backtesting proof
- **Data quality**: Entity resolution improves all downstream features

### Tier 3: Platform Enhancement (Priority 11-15)
- **Infrastructure**: Systematic data pipeline improvements
- **User experience**: Better presentation of our accurate predictions  
- **Advanced features**: Regime change detection and real-time adjustments

## Implementation Strategy

### Next 2 Weeks (Sprint Focus)
1. **ADH-015**: Quick win - utilize existing Kaggle data we already have
2. **LLM-001**: High-value news signal extraction implementation

### Month 1 Priority  
3. **LLM-002**: Make predictions explainable and trustworthy
4. **MOD-005**: Integrate advanced NFL statistics (EPA, DVOA)
5. **MOD-004**: Add injury data integration

### Key Dependencies
- **ADH-015 ‚Üí LLM-001**: Historical context enables better news analysis
- **LLM-001 ‚Üí LLM-002**: Extract signals before building citation trails  
- **MOD-005 + MOD-004**: Can be developed in parallel to LLM work

## Business Impact Assessment

### Immediate Revenue Impact (Priority 1-5)
- **Accuracy improvement**: News + injury data could boost model performance 2-5%
- **User retention**: Explainable picks increase user confidence and subscriptions
- **Competitive moat**: Advanced statistics integration matches professional handicappers

### User Confidence Building (Priority 6-10)
- **Trust**: AI explanations and backtesting proof build credibility
- **Value demonstration**: ROI tracking shows concrete financial benefits
- **Market edge**: Contrarian strategies differentiate from basic prediction sites

### Platform Excellence (Priority 11-15)  
- **Scalability**: Better data pipelines enable rapid feature addition
- **User experience**: Enhanced UI makes predictions more engaging
- **Advanced features**: Regime change and real-time adjustments for power users
