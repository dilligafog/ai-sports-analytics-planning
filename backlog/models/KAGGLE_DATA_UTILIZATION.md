# KAGGLE_DATA_UTILIZATION: Kaggle Data Utilization

## User Story
**As a** Data Scientist  
**I want** to fully leverage our existing Kaggle NFL datasets  
**So that** I can extract additional predictive signals and historical context for our models

## Business Value
- Enhanced model accuracy through richer historical data
- Improved feature engineering with comprehensive NFL statistics
- Better backtesting capabilities with historical betting data
- Deeper insights from play-by-play and player performance data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete inventory of all available Kaggle NFL datasets documented
- [ ] Data quality assessment completed for each dataset
- [ ] Priority ranking established based on predictive value
- [ ] Bronze layer transformation pipeline implemented for top 3 datasets
- [ ] Feature engineering algorithms developed for key data types
- [ ] Historical play-by-play data integrated into feature store
- [ ] Betting history data accessible for backtesting
- [ ] ML models successfully access new Kaggle-derived features
- [ ] Performance improvement measured and documented

## Technical Requirements
- Data processing scripts for CSV/JSON Kaggle datasets
- Bronze/silver layer transformation pipelines
- Feature engineering for temporal, statistical, and betting data
- Integration with existing feature store architecture
- Data validation and quality monitoring

## Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Dataset inventory and quality assessment
2. **Week 2**: Priority ranking and pipeline design
3. **Week 3**: Bronze layer implementation for high-priority datasets
4. **Week 4**: Feature engineering and integration testing

## Dependencies
None identified

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Large scope, multiple data formats to handle
- **Timeline**: 3 story points (2-3 weeks)
- **Resources**: 1 data engineer for pipeline work
- **Mitigation**: Start with highest-impact datasets first

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] New features successfully used in model training
- [ ] Performance metrics show improvement
- [ ] Documentation updated for new data sources
5. Create feature engineering for high-value signals
6. Integrate with ML models
7. Update UI and LLM to access new insights

## Definition of Done
- High-value Kaggle datasets are fully processed in bronze/silver layers
- Feature engineering extracts valuable signals from these datasets
- ML models incorporate features from Kaggle data
- UI and LLM can reference insights derived from Kaggle data
- Documentation exists for all Kaggle data transformations
