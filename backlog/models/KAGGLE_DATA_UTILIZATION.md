# User Story: Kaggle Data Utilization

## Overview
**As a** data scientist  
**I want** to fully leverage our existing Kaggle NFL datasets  
**So that** I can extract additional predictive signals and historical context for our models

## Value Proposition
We have a substantial collection of untapped Kaggle data including game scores, play-by-play data, player statistics, team statistics, betting data, and more. Properly integrating this data into our feature engineering process will enhance model accuracy and provide richer historical context for predictions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All relevant Kaggle datasets are analyzed and cataloged with their potential value
- Data is transformed from raw format to normalized bronze/silver layers
- Feature engineering pipelines extract valuable signals from Kaggle data
- Historical play-by-play data is utilized for advanced metrics
- Betting history data is incorporated into backtesting
- ML models can access features derived from Kaggle datasets
- UI and LLM components can reference insights from Kaggle data

## Technical Requirements
- Create data processing scripts for each valuable Kaggle dataset
- Implement bronze/silver transformation pipelines
- Develop feature engineering algorithms for each dataset type
- Integrate with existing ML pipelines
- Update UI and LLM components to access new data

## Implementation Plan
1. Complete inventory of available Kaggle datasets
2. Assess data quality and potential value of each dataset
3. Prioritize datasets based on potential impact
4. Implement data processing for high-priority datasets
5. Create feature engineering for high-value signals
6. Integrate with ML models
7. Update UI and LLM to access new insights

## Definition of Done
- High-value Kaggle datasets are fully processed in bronze/silver layers
- Feature engineering extracts valuable signals from these datasets
- ML models incorporate features from Kaggle data
- UI and LLM can reference insights derived from Kaggle data
- Documentation exists for all Kaggle data transformations

## Related Features
- Data Source Integration Framework (dependency)
- Gold Feature Store (will be enhanced)
- Backtesting & ROI Tracking (will be enhanced)
