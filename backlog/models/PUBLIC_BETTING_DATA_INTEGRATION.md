# PUBLIC_BETTING_DATA_INTEGRATION: Public Betting Data Integration

## User Story
**As a** Betting Analyst  
**I want** public betting data integrated into our prediction system  
**So that** I can identify value opportunities where our predictions differ from public sentiment

## Business Value
- **Contrarian betting opportunities** by identifying over/under-valued games
- **Market efficiency analysis** to understand where public sentiment drives poor lines
- **Enhanced prediction accuracy** through sentiment analysis integration
- **Competitive advantage** in identifying value bets before the market corrects

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Data Collection**: System collects public betting percentages from multiple sportsbooks
- [x] **Line Movement Tracking**: Historical line movement data for trend analysis
- [x] **Money Distribution**: Track money distribution across different bet types
- [x] **Data Standardization**: Process data into normalized format for feature engineering
- [x] **Historical Analysis**: Minimum 6 months of historical betting data available
- [x] **UI Integration**: Public betting information displayed alongside predictions
- [ ] **LLM Context**: _MOVED TO SEPARATE PROPOSAL - AI_BETTING_NARRATIVE_GENERATION_

## Technical Requirements
- **Data Sources**: Multiple sportsbook APIs for comprehensive coverage
- **Data Schema**: Standardized schema for betting trend data storage
- **Analysis Tools**: Line movement analysis and betting pattern detection
- **UI Components**: Visualization components for betting trends
- **LLM Integration**: Public betting context in LLM prompts and responses

## Implementation Plan
1. **Research Phase**: Identify and evaluate reliable public betting data sources
2. **Data Collection**: Implement collection from 3+ sportsbook APIs
3. **Data Processing**: Create bronze/silver layer transformation pipelines
4. **Analysis Tools**: Develop line movement and trend analysis capabilities
5. **UI Integration**: Add betting trend visualizations to prediction interface
6. **LLM Enhancement**: Integrate public betting context into LLM workflows

## Dependencies
None identified

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: API reliability and data quality concerns
- **Timeline**: 5 story points (3-4 weeks)
- **Resources**: 1 backend engineer for data collection, 1 frontend engineer for UI
- **Mitigation**: Start with one reliable data source, expand gradually

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive testing
- [x] Public betting data successfully collected from multiple sources
- [x] Historical analysis shows correlation with prediction accuracy
- [x] UI displays betting trends alongside predictions
- [ ] LLM can reference public betting context in outputs _MOVED TO SEPARATE PROPOSAL_

## Definition of Done
- Public betting data is collected, processed, and available in the system
- UI displays public betting percentages and line movement
- Value bet identification considers divergence from public sentiment
- _LLM narrative generation moved to separate AI_BETTING_NARRATIVE_GENERATION proposal_
