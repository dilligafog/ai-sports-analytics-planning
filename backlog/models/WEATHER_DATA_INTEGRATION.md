# User Story: Weather Data Integration

## Overview
**As a** betting analyst  
**I want** historical and forecast weather data integrated into predictions  
**So that** I can assess weather impacts on game totals and team performance

## Value Proposition
Weather conditions significantly impact scoring and team performance, particularly for outdoor stadiums. Integrating weather data provides critical context for over/under bets and team-specific predictions in adverse conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System collects historical and forecast weather data for game locations
- Data includes temperature, precipitation, wind speed/direction, and other relevant metrics
- Weather data is associated with specific games and venues
- Machine learning features incorporate weather conditions
- UI displays weather information for upcoming games
- LLM can reference weather conditions in betting narratives

## Technical Requirements
- Implement data collection from weather APIs/services
- Create schema for weather data storage
- Develop feature engineering for weather impact
- Integrate weather data into ML pipelines
- Expose weather data to UI and LLM components

## Implementation Plan
1. Research and select optimal weather data sources
2. Implement data collection and storage
3. Create venue database with dome/outdoor classification
4. Develop feature engineering for weather impact
5. Integrate with prediction models
6. Update UI to display weather information
7. Enhance LLM prompts to include weather context

## Definition of Done
- Weather data is collected, processed, and available in the feature store
- ML models can access weather features for predictions
- UI displays relevant weather information for games
- LLM generates narratives that reference significant weather factors

## Related Features
- Data Source Integration Framework (dependency)
- Venue Database (dependency)
- Feature Engineering (will be enhanced)
- Predictions & Outputs (will be enhanced)
