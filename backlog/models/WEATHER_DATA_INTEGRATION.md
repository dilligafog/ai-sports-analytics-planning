# WEATHER_DATA_INTEGRATION: Weather Data Integration

## User Story
**As a** Betting Analyst  
**I want** historical and forecast weather data integrated into predictions  
**So that** I can assess weather impacts on game totals and team performance

## Business Value
- **Improved over/under predictions** by accounting for weather impact on scoring
- **Team performance analysis** in adverse weather conditions
- **Venue-specific insights** for dome vs outdoor stadiums
- **Competitive advantage** in weather-affected games

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Weather Data Collection**: System collects historical and forecast weather data for all game locations
- [ ] **Comprehensive Metrics**: Temperature, precipitation, wind speed/direction, humidity, and visibility
- [ ] **Game Association**: Weather data properly linked to specific games and venues
- [ ] **Venue Classification**: Database of stadiums with dome/outdoor classification
- [ ] **ML Integration**: Weather features incorporated into prediction models
- [ ] **UI Display**: Weather information shown for upcoming games
- [ ] **LLM Context**: Weather conditions accessible for betting narrative generation

## Technical Requirements
- **Data Sources**: Reliable weather API (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.)
- **Data Schema**: Standardized weather data storage with historical and forecast data
- **Feature Engineering**: Weather impact features (precipitation effects, wind impact, etc.)
- **Venue Database**: Stadium classification and weather station mapping
- **ML Pipeline**: Weather features integrated into existing model training

## Implementation Plan
1. **Research Phase**: Evaluate weather APIs for reliability and coverage
2. **Data Collection**: Implement collection for historical and forecast data
3. **Venue Mapping**: Create comprehensive stadium database with classifications
4. **Feature Development**: Develop weather impact features for ML models
5. **Model Integration**: Incorporate weather features into prediction pipelines
6. **UI Enhancement**: Add weather displays to game information views

## Dependencies
None identified

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Well-established weather APIs and data formats
- **Timeline**: 3 story points (2-3 weeks)
- **Resources**: 1 backend engineer for data collection and integration
- **Mitigation**: Start with one reliable weather API, expand coverage gradually

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive testing
- [ ] Weather data successfully collected for all NFL stadiums
- [ ] ML models show improved accuracy with weather features
- [ ] UI displays weather information for upcoming games
- [ ] Weather context available to LLM for enhanced narratives
6. Update UI to display weather information
7. Enhance LLM prompts to include weather context

## Definition of Done
- Weather data is collected, processed, and available in the feature store
- ML models can access weather features for predictions
- UI displays relevant weather information for games
- LLM generates narratives that reference significant weather factors

## Related Features
- Data Source Integration Framework (dependency)
- Venue Database (dependency)
- Feature Engineering (will be enhanced)
- Predictions & Outputs (will be enhanced)
