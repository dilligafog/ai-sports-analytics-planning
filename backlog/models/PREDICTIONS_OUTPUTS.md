# User Story: Predictions & Outputs

## Overview
**As a** sports bettor  
**I want** clear predictions for upcoming games  
**So that** I can make informed betting decisions

## Value Proposition
Translates model outputs into actionable predictions that drive the end-user experience. This is the core value delivery of the system that enables users to place informed bets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System generates predictions for all games in the current week
- Predictions include confidence scores and supporting metrics
- Outputs are formatted consistently and stored in a structured way
- Predictions are available for different betting markets

## Technical Requirements
- Implement `busta predict <week>` command
- Create prediction pipeline that uses trained models
- Develop output format with all necessary information
- Store predictions in `data/predictions/` with appropriate organization

## Implementation Plan
1. Design prediction process workflow
2. Implement prediction generation for each market type
3. Create consistent output format with confidence scores
4. Develop storage strategy for predictions
5. Build integration with downstream systems (UI, reporting)

## Definition of Done
- Predictions generate for all games with confidence scores
- Outputs include all necessary context for decision-making
- Prediction files are consistently formatted and organized
- Command works reliably for all supported betting markets
