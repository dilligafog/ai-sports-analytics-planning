# INF-003: Caching & TTL for time-sensitive signals

- **Overview**: As a platform engineer, I want caching and expirations so that stale news doesnâ€™t leak into predictions.
- **Value Proposition**: Controls cost and correctness for LLM and news retrieval.

## Acceptance Criteria
- LLM feature cache keyed by `cluster_id` with 24h TTL (configurable).
- News fetch cache with ETag/Last-Modified; odds cache 60s.
- Monitoring warns when signals exceed TTL during inference.

## Technical Requirements
- Cache to disk with metadata index; purge cron/task.
- TTL enforcement in feature loader; warnings bubble to reports.
- Configurable via `config/runtime.yml`.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement cache layer and TTL checks.
- Add monitoring hooks to inference.
- Write tests for expiry and refresh behavior.

## Definition of Done
- Expired entries are refreshed automatically.
- No inference run uses signals older than TTL.
