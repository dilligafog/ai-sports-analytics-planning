# Fix Inventory App Sidebar UI Layout Issues

## User Story

**As a** data engineer or analyst using the inventory app  
**I want** a clean, well-organized sidebar interface  
**So that** I can easily navigate filters and settings without visual clutter

## Problem Statement

The current inventory app sidebar (`apps/inventory/app.py`) has several visual and usability issues that make it look "janky":

1. **Long path display** - The processed directory path takes up excessive vertical space
2. **Cramped layout** - Three columns squeezed into narrow sidebar space  
3. **Mixed content hierarchy** - Settings, filters, and jobs mixed without clear separation
4. **Verbose job listings** - Long job descriptions and paths cluttering the interface
5. **Poor visual hierarchy** - No clear grouping or spacing between different sections

## Current Issues in Code

```python
# Problematic layout patterns:
st.sidebar.code(str(PROCESSED_DIR), language="bash")  # Very long path display
colA, colB, colC = st.sidebar.columns(3)  # Too cramped in narrow sidebar
# Verbose job listings without size limits
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Replace long path display with compact version (show just key folder names)
- [ ] Remove cramped 3-column layout, use vertical stacking instead
- [ ] Add clear visual separators between major sidebar sections
- [ ] Limit job listings to most recent 3 jobs with compact display
- [ ] Use consistent header styles with visual hierarchy

### Should Have  
- [ ] Add helpful icons to section headers for visual clarity
- [ ] Include helpful tooltips and captions for complex features
- [ ] Implement preset options for common gap criteria instead of many checkboxes
- [ ] Add expandable section for full path details when needed

### Could Have
- [ ] Implement sidebar tabs to separate Filters / Settings / Jobs
- [ ] Add mobile-responsive layout considerations
- [ ] Include quick preset buttons for common filter combinations

## Technical Implementation

### Before (Current Issues)
```python
# Current problematic code patterns:
st.sidebar.header("Inventory Settings")
st.sidebar.write("**Processed dir**")
st.sidebar.code(str(PROCESSED_DIR), language="bash")  # LONG PATH!

colA, colB, colC = st.sidebar.columns(3)  # TOO CRAMPED
with colA:
    st.write("**Seasons**")
with colB:
    selected_seasons = st.multiselect("Select seasons", seasons, default=seasons)
with colC:
    only_gaps = st.checkbox("Only gaps", value=False)
```

### After (Clean Implementation)
```python
# Proposed clean layout:
st.sidebar.header("üì¶ Data Inventory")

# Compact location info
processed_name = PROCESSED_DIR.name
parent_name = PROCESSED_DIR.parent.name
st.sidebar.caption(f"üìÅ {parent_name}/{processed_name}")

st.sidebar.markdown("---")

# Streamlined filters (vertical layout)
st.sidebar.subheader("üîç Filters")
selected_seasons = st.sidebar.multiselect("Seasons", seasons, default=seasons)
only_gaps = st.sidebar.checkbox("üö´ Show only gaps", value=False)

# Compact job status (top 3 only)
if jobs:
    st.sidebar.subheader("‚ö° Recent Jobs")
    for j in jobs[:3]:
        status_icon = {"queued": "‚è≥", "running": "üîÑ", "completed": "‚úÖ", "failed": "‚ùå"}.get(j['state'], "‚ùì")
        st.sidebar.caption(f"{status_icon} #{j['id'][:6]} - {j['state']}")
```

## User Experience Impact

### Current Problems
- **Cognitive overload**: Too much information crammed into narrow space
- **Poor usability**: Difficult to scan and find relevant controls
- **Visual clutter**: Long paths and verbose job descriptions
- **Inconsistent spacing**: Mixed content without clear organization

### Expected Improvements
- **70% less visual clutter** through compact displays and better organization
- **Faster task completion** with logical grouping and clear hierarchy
- **Better mobile experience** with vertical layout instead of cramped columns
- **Improved scannability** with consistent icons and section separators

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Sidebar displays cleanly without horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Path information is compact but still accessible
- [ ] Filter controls are easy to use without cramped layout
- [ ] Job listings don't overwhelm the interface
- [ ] Visual hierarchy is clear with proper spacing and separators
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Manual testing confirms improved usability across different screen sizes

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test sidebar layout on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality still works
- [ ] Check that long paths display properly in compact format
- [ ] Confirm job listings update correctly

### Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Compare before/after screenshots
- [ ] Verify consistent spacing and alignment
- [ ] Check icon alignment and readability

## Notes

- This is a pure UI improvement with no functional changes
- Implementation should maintain backward compatibility
- Focus on immediate visual improvements before adding new features
- Consider this a prerequisite for the broader inventory enhancement proposal
