# UI-003 - Data Source Management Web Interface

**Status**: New  
**Epic**: ui  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: Low  
**Dependencies**: DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK, INF-008  

## User Story
**As a** data platform administrator  
**I want** a web interface to manage data sources  
**So that** I can configure, monitor, and troubleshoot data sources without using the CLI

## Background
The DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK provides a powerful CLI (`busta sources`) and registry system. A web interface would make data source management more accessible and provide better visualization of the comprehensive quality metrics and health data.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Data Source Discovery & Configuration
- [ ] **Source Catalog**: Visual grid showing all registered data sources with status and metadata
- [ ] **Source Details**: Detailed view with configuration, quality metrics, and collection history
- [ ] **Configuration Editor**: Web form to modify data source settings and validation rules
- [ ] **Test Connections**: One-click connectivity testing from the web interface

### Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] **Quality Dashboard**: Visual charts showing data quality trends and current scores
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Response times, collection success rates, and throughput graphs
- [ ] **Health Status**: Real-time status indicators with drill-down to specific issues
- [ ] **Historical Analysis**: Time-series charts for quality and performance over time

### Management Operations
- [ ] **Collection Controls**: Start, stop, and schedule data collection jobs from the web
- [ ] **Validation Triggers**: Manual validation runs with real-time results display
- [ ] **Alert Management**: Configure monitoring thresholds and notification settings
- [ ] **Maintenance Mode**: Temporarily disable sources during maintenance windows

### User Experience
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and tablet devices
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates without page refresh
- [ ] **Search & Filtering**: Find specific data sources by name, type, status, or quality score
- [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple sources for batch operations

## Technical Approach
- **React Frontend**: Modern SPA with real-time updates via WebSocket
- **API Integration**: REST endpoints leveraging existing framework components
- **Chart Library**: Interactive visualizations for quality and performance metrics
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling for real-time data updates

## Business Value
- **Improved Accessibility**: Non-technical users can manage data sources
- **Better Visualization**: Rich charts and dashboards for data source analytics
- **Faster Troubleshooting**: Visual interface speeds up issue identification and resolution
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce CLI expertise requirement for routine operations

## Risks
- **Complexity**: Large story requiring significant frontend development
- **Performance**: Real-time updates could impact system performance
- **Security**: Web interface requires proper authentication and authorization

## Notes
- Consider implementing in phases: view-only first, then management features
- Leverage existing Rich CLI output formatting for consistent styling
- Integrate with health monitoring system (INF-008) for real-time alerts
- Could be combined with or built upon existing UI architecture from accepted stories
