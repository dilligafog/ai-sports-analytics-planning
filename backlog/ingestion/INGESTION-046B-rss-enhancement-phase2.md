# INGESTION-046B: RSS Feed Enhancement Phase 2 - Team Coverage Expansion

## User Story
**As a** data analyst and prediction model developer  
**I want** comprehensive team-specific RSS coverage from trusted sources  
**So that** I have deeper insights into team dynamics, coaching decisions, and local perspectives for major market teams

## Value Proposition
Phase 2 expands our team coverage from 4 sources to 11+ sources, focusing on major market teams through SB Nation's expert blogs and local newspaper coverage. This provides team-specific intelligence that national sources often miss, especially valuable for coaching behavior and insider information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add 7 new team-focused RSS feeds to `config/rss_feeds.yaml`
- [ ] Add 2 new categories: `team_blog_enhanced`, `local_media`
- [ ] All feeds validated for team-specific content quality
- [ ] Feed overlap analysis completed to avoid duplicates
- [ ] System load testing with 13 total new feeds (Phase 1 + 2)
- [ ] Team coverage mapping documented

### New RSS Sources to Add:
1. **Pats Pulpit** (Patriots SB Nation, priority: 7)

   - Value: Pittsburgh coverage, strong fanbase insights

5. **Big Blue View** (Giants SB Nation, priority: 6)

   - Value: Major market local coverage

## Technical Notes
- Depends on successful completion of Phase 1 (INGESTION-046A)
- Monitor for duplicate content between team sources and national feeds
- SB Nation feeds follow consistent RSS format patterns
- Local newspaper feeds may have different update frequencies
- Consider rate limiting per source domain to be respectful

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 7 team-focused feeds successfully integrated
- [ ] No duplicate content issues identified (>95% unique articles)
- [ ] Feed health monitoring stable for all Phase 1 + Phase 2 feeds
- [ ] Team coverage gaps analysis completed for Phase 3 planning
