# INGESTION-046A: RSS Feed Enhancement Phase 1 - Analytics & Betting Core

## User Story
**As a** data engineer and prediction model developer  
**I want** enhanced RSS feeds from analytics and betting experts  
**So that** I have access to professional-grade insights for signal extraction and model validation

## Value Proposition
Phase 1 adds the highest-impact RSS sources that provide professional analytics and betting intelligence. These 6 feeds represent industry leaders and will immediately enhance our LLM signal extraction capabilities with expert analysis not available in basic sports news.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add 6 new high-priority RSS feeds to `config/rss_feeds.yaml`
- [ ] Add 3 new categories: `analytics`, `betting`, `contracts`
- [ ] All feeds verified for accessibility and content quality
- [ ] Feed health monitoring integrated for new sources
- [ ] System performance validated with additional load
- [ ] Documentation updated with new feed descriptions

### New RSS Sources to Add:
1. **Football Outsiders** (analytics, priority: 9)
   - URL: `https://www.footballoutsiders.com/rss.xml`
   - Value: DVOA pioneers, advanced statistical analysis

2. **Action Network NFL** (betting, priority: 9)
   - URL: `https://www.actionnetwork.com/nfl/rss`
   - Value: Professional betting analysis, sharp money indicators

3. **Pro Football Doc** (medical, priority: 8)
   - URL: `https://profootballdoc.com/feed/`
   - Value: Dr. David Chao's medical injury analysis

4. **Spotrac NFL** (contracts, priority: 7)
   - URL: `https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/rss/`
   - Value: Salary cap analysis, contract insights

5. **BBC Sport NFL** (international, priority: 5)
   - URL: `https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/sport/american-football/rss.xml`
   - Value: European perspective, different analytical approach

6. **VegasInsider NFL** (betting, priority: 7)
   - URL: `https://www.vegasinsider.com/rss/news/nfl/`
   - Value: Betting lines, injury impact on spreads

## Technical Notes
- Use verification script from PR 46 to validate all feeds before integration
- Follow existing `rss_feeds.yaml` schema with new category additions
- Implement rate limiting and respectful request patterns
- Monitor feed health after deployment for 1 week before Phase 2
- Leverage existing `MultiFormatFeedParser` and `FeedHealth` infrastructure

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 6 feeds successfully integrated and collecting data
- [ ] Feed health monitoring shows >95% success rate for Priority 1 feeds
- [ ] No performance degradation in existing RSS collection
- [ ] Configuration validated through `busta pipeline collect news`
- [ ] Documentation updated in system docs
- [ ] Phase 2 readiness assessment completed
