# QLT-003: Feature store monitoring and drift detection

- **Overview**: As a data scientist, I want real-time monitoring of feature quality and drift so that model degradation is detected before it impacts predictions.
- **Value Proposition**: Prevents silent model failures by catching data quality issues, feature drift, and pipeline breakages early.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Monitor feature completeness, distribution shifts, and correlation changes
- Alert on feature freshness violations (e.g., LLM features >24h old)
- Drift detection using statistical tests (KS test, PSI) with configurable thresholds
- Dashboard showing feature health status across all data sources
- Integration with model performance monitoring to correlate drift with accuracy

## Technical Requirements
- Real-time feature quality metrics computed during pipeline execution
- Statistical drift detection with baseline period and rolling windows
- Configurable alerting via email/Slack with severity levels
- Historical trend tracking for all monitored features
- Integration with existing logging infrastructure (QLT-002)

## Implementation Plan
1. **Define feature quality metrics** (completeness, distribution, correlations)
2. **Implement drift detection** algorithms with baseline establishment
3. **Create monitoring dashboard** showing real-time feature health
4. **Add alerting system** with configurable thresholds and notifications
5. **Integrate with model monitoring** to correlate drift with performance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All critical features monitored for drift and quality
- [ ] Alerts trigger within 1 hour of significant drift detection
- [ ] Dashboard provides clear feature health overview
- [ ] Historical drift trends tracked and queryable
- [ ] False positive rate <10% on drift alerts
