# QLT-004: Production Data Quality Monitoring

- **Overview**: As a data engineer, I want continuous data quality monitoring in production so that data issues are caught when they actually occur.
- **Value Proposition**: Real-time detection of data quality issues where the data actually lives.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Production Pipeline Integration**: Quality checks run automatically after each data ingestion
- **Real Data Validation**: Checks run against actual bronze/silver/gold data in production
- **Automated Alerting**: Notifications sent when quality thresholds are exceeded
- **Quality Dashboards**: Web interface showing data quality metrics over time
- **Failure Handling**: Pipeline can continue with warnings or halt on critical issues

## Technical Requirements
- **Post-Ingestion Hooks**: Quality checks triggered after each `busta ingest` command
- **Threshold Configuration**: Configurable error rates and alert levels
- **Alert Integration**: Email/Slack/webhook notifications for quality failures  
- **Metrics Storage**: Historical quality metrics stored for trending
- **CLI Integration**: `busta quality-check` command for manual validation

## Implementation Plan
1. **Build quality check framework** that integrates with existing pipeline
2. **Add post-ingestion hooks** to automatically trigger quality validation
3. **Implement configurable alerting** with multiple notification channels
4. **Create quality metrics dashboard** for monitoring trends
5. **Add manual CLI commands** for on-demand quality checks

## Definition of Done
- **Automated execution** after each data ingestion in production
- **Alert system** notifies team of quality issues within 15 minutes
- **Dashboard** shows quality trends and current status
- **CLI commands** allow manual quality validation
- **Documentation** explains quality monitoring system
