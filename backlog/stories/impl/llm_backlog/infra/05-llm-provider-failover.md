# INF-005: LLM provider failover and model versioning

- **Overview**: As a platform engineer, I want robust LLM provider management so that API failures don't break the pipeline and model changes are tracked.
- **Value Proposition**: Ensures system reliability and reproducibility when LLM providers have outages or change models.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) with automatic failover
- Model version tracking with ability to pin specific versions for reproducibility
- Rate limiting and exponential backoff for API calls
- Cost monitoring and spending alerts per provider
- Graceful degradation when all providers fail (use cached results or abstain)

## Technical Requirements
- Provider abstraction layer with unified interface
- Configuration-driven provider priority and fallback rules
- API key rotation support for security
- Comprehensive logging of provider performance and costs
- Integration with existing caching system (INF-003)

## Implementation Plan
1. **Design provider abstraction** with unified interface for all LLM calls
2. **Implement failover logic** with configurable retry and backoff strategies
3. **Add model versioning** to track and pin specific model versions
4. **Create cost monitoring** with alerts and budget limits
5. **Add graceful degradation** when providers unavailable

## Definition of Done
- [ ] System continues functioning during provider outages
- [ ] All LLM calls logged with provider, model version, cost, and latency
- [ ] Cost alerts trigger before budget limits exceeded
- [ ] Reproducible results with pinned model versions
- [ ] <5 second failover time between providers
