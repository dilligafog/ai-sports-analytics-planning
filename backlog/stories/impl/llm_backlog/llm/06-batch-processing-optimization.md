# LLM-006: Batch processing optimization for LLM features

- **Overview**: As a platform engineer, I want efficient batch processing for LLM features so that we can process hundreds of articles cost-effectively.
- **Value Proposition**: Reduces LLM API costs by 40-60% through batching and reduces processing time through parallelization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Batch processing of articles with optimal batch sizes per LLM provider
- Parallel processing with configurable concurrency limits
- Smart batching that groups similar articles to improve context efficiency
- Progress tracking and resumable processing for large batches
- Cost optimization through batch size and provider selection

## Technical Requirements
- Async processing framework supporting multiple concurrent LLM calls
- Intelligent batching algorithm considering article similarity and context limits
- Progress persistence to enable resumable processing after failures
- Dynamic batch size optimization based on provider performance
- Integration with caching system to avoid reprocessing

## Implementation Plan
1. **Design batch processing architecture** with async workers and job queues
2. **Implement intelligent batching** based on article clustering and context limits
3. **Add progress tracking** with resumable processing capabilities
4. **Optimize batch sizes** dynamically based on provider performance
5. **Integrate with caching** to maximize efficiency

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Process 500+ articles in <2 hours with standard LLM provider limits
- [ ] 40%+ cost reduction vs sequential processing
- [ ] Resumable processing survives worker failures
- [ ] Batch size optimization improves throughput by 25%+
- [ ] Integration with existing caching reduces redundant calls
