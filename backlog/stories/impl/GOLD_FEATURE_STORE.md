# User Story: Gold Feature Store

## Overview
**As a** data scientist  
**I want** a canonical feature store with consistent schemas  
**So that** model training is reproducible and features are standardized

## Value Proposition
Provides a single "truth layer" of features that prevents drift and ensures reproducibility across model iterations. This enables consistent model training and evaluation while making feature engineering transparent.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All features follow defined schemas with appropriate data types
- ETL processes populate gold datasets from raw/bronze/silver data
- All model inputs come exclusively from the gold feature store
- Feature versioning allows tracking changes over time

## Technical Requirements
- Define schemas for all feature types (team stats, game stats, odds, etc.)
- Implement ETL processes to transform and validate data
- Store gold features in `data/gold/` with appropriate organization
- Create documentation for available features

## Implementation Plan
1. Define feature schemas and documentation standards
2. Implement ETL pipelines for core feature sets
3. Develop validation checks for data quality
4. Create feature catalog for discoverability
5. Implement versioning strategy

## Definition of Done
- All models use features exclusively from the gold feature store
- Features meet quality and completeness standards
- Documentation exists for all available features
- ETL processes run reliably and maintain data integrity
