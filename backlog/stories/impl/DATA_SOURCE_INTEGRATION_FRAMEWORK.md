# User Story: Data Source Integration Framework

## Overview
**As a** data engineer  
**I want** a standardized framework for integrating new data sources  
**So that** we can consistently add new predictive signals with minimal effort

## Value Proposition
Enables rapid integration of new data sources to enhance prediction accuracy and add unique insights. A standardized framework reduces development time and ensures consistent data handling across all sources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- New data sources can be added without modifying core pipeline code
- Standard interfaces exist for data collection, validation, and transformation
- Integration points are defined for machine learning, LLM training, and UI access
- Data quality checks are automatically applied to new sources
- Documentation template exists for new data sources

## Technical Requirements
- Create abstract base classes/interfaces for data source integration
- Implement standardized data validation and schema enforcement
- Define standard metadata requirements for new sources
- Develop automated testing framework for data sources
- Create configuration templates for new source definitions

## Implementation Plan
1. Design abstract interfaces for data source classes
2. Create data quality validation framework
3. Implement metadata generation for new sources
4. Develop documentation templates for source integration
5. Build integration tests for the framework

## Definition of Done
- Framework allows adding new sources without modifying core code
- New sources automatically integrate with ML pipelines, LLMs, and UI
- Documentation exists for implementing new data sources
- Integration tests validate the framework's functionality
