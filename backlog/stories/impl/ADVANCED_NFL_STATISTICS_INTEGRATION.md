# User Story: Advanced NFL Statistics Integration

## Overview
**As a** data scientist  
**I want** advanced NFL statistics integrated into our prediction system  
**So that** I can build more accurate models based on detailed performance metrics

## Value Proposition
Advanced statistics provide deeper insights into team and player performance beyond basic box scores. Integrating metrics like EPA, DVOA, and Next Gen Stats creates predictive advantages and more nuanced betting recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System collects advanced statistics from specialized sources
- Data includes team and player efficiency metrics, advanced situational stats, and play-by-play data
- Historical data is available for model training and backtesting
- Data is processed into a standardized format for feature engineering
- ML models can incorporate advanced metrics as features
- UI can display relevant advanced statistics for context
- LLM can reference advanced statistics in betting narratives

## Technical Requirements
- Implement data collection from specialized NFL stats providers
- Create schema for advanced statistics storage
- Develop feature engineering for advanced metrics
- Integrate advanced stats into ML pipelines
- Expose relevant metrics to UI and LLM components

## Implementation Plan
1. Research and select optimal advanced statistics sources
2. Implement data collection and storage
3. Create feature engineering for advanced metrics
4. Integrate with prediction models
5. Update UI to display relevant advanced stats
6. Enhance LLM prompts to include advanced statistical context

## Definition of Done
- Advanced statistics are collected, processed, and available in the feature store
- ML models can access advanced features for predictions
- UI displays relevant advanced statistics for context
- LLM generates narratives that reference key advanced metrics

## Related Features
- Data Source Integration Framework (dependency)
- Feature Engineering (will be enhanced)
- Model Training & Evaluation (will be enhanced)
