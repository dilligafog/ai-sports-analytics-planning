# Personalized AI Sales Pitch Generation

## User Story

**As a** sports bettor  
**I want** AI-generated sales pitches tailored to my betting preferences and history  
**So that** I receive more relevant and compelling recommendations

## Background

The AI_GENERATED_SALES_PITCH system currently generates generic sales pitches for all users. With the multi-tier inference architecture now in place, we can enhance the system to generate personalized content based on:
- User betting history and preferences
- Risk tolerance and betting patterns
- Preferred betting markets (moneyline, spread, totals)
- Historical success rates with similar recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Personalization Engine
- [ ] User profile system capturing betting preferences and history
- [ ] Personalization algorithms for tailoring AI pitch content
- [ ] A/B testing framework for pitch effectiveness
- [ ] Privacy-preserving user data handling

### Enhanced AI Generation
- [ ] Extend AI prompts to include user context and preferences
- [ ] Generate pitches with personalized risk/reward messaging
- [ ] Include user-relevant historical analogies and examples
- [ ] Adjust tone and complexity based on user experience level

### User Interface  
- [ ] User preference settings for pitch style and content
- [ ] Feedback mechanism for pitch quality and relevance
- [ ] Opt-in/opt-out controls for personalization features
- [ ] Clear indication when content is personalized vs generic

### Analytics & Optimization
- [ ] Track personalization effectiveness vs generic pitches
- [ ] Measure user engagement and conversion improvements
- [ ] A/B test different personalization strategies
- [ ] Privacy-compliant analytics and user insights

## Implementation Notes

**Technical Considerations:**
- Leverage existing multi-tier AI infrastructure
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance for user data
- Implement gradual rollout with feature flags
- Design for scalability across user base

**Personalization Factors:**
- Betting market preferences (spread vs moneyline vs totals)
- Risk tolerance (conservative vs aggressive)
- Team/league preferences and knowledge level
- Historical success rate with different bet types

## Success Metrics

- Increase user engagement with AI pitches by 40%
- Improve click-through rate on recommendations by 25%
- Achieve higher user satisfaction scores (>4.5/5.0)
- Maintain privacy compliance and user trust metrics

## Dependencies

- âœ… AI_GENERATED_SALES_PITCH (provides base AI infrastructure)
- UI-002-sales-pitch-integration (web integration for user interaction)
- User authentication and profile system
- Privacy compliance framework

## Effort Estimate

**8 story points** - High complexity requiring:
- Personalization engine development (40%)
- AI prompt engineering and testing (30%)
- Privacy and compliance implementation (20%)
- Analytics and optimization framework (10%)

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning models for preference prediction
- Real-time personalization based on current session behavior
- Social proof integration (similar users' success stories)
- Multi-language personalization for diverse user base
