# INF-008: Data Source Health Monitoring & Alerting

## Assessment: Low Priority Based on Current Data Source Health

**Feed Health Analysis (2025-08-29):**
- **Active Feeds**: 60+ RSS feeds working reliably (ESPN, BBC, CBS, Yahoo, etc.)
- **Minor Issues**: ~10 feeds with intermittent problems (mostly 404s on old URLs)
- **Disabled Feeds**: ~15 feeds with persistent failures (likely deprecated sources)
- **Overall Health**: 70%+ of feeds functioning normally

**Conclusion**: Most data sources are stable. Monitoring system can be deferred until we see more widespread issues or add new data sources that need monitoring.

## User Story (Deferred)
**As a** Data Platform Operator
**I want** real-time monitoring and alerting for data source health
**So that** I can quickly respond to data quality issues and source outages

## Current Status
- **Priority**: Lowered to 8 (was 5) - not urgent based on current feed health
- **Status**: Backlog - monitoring not needed at this time
- **Next Review**: Reassess when adding new data sources or if feed failure rate exceeds 20%

## Acceptance Criteria (Future Implementation)

### Health Monitoring
- [ ] **Real-time Health Checks**: 5-minute interval connectivity and response time monitoring
- [ ] **Quality Trend Analysis**: Track data quality metrics over 30-day rolling windows
- [ ] **Performance Baselines**: Establish normal operating ranges for each data source type
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical analysis to identify unusual patterns in collection or quality

### Alerting System
- [ ] **Configurable Thresholds**: Quality scores (<90%), response times (>5s), failure rates (>5%)
- [ ] **Multi-channel Notifications**: Email, Slack, and webhook support for different alert severities
- [ ] **Smart Escalation**: Progressive escalation (warning â†’ critical) for unresolved issues
- [ ] **Maintenance Windows**: Alert suppression during scheduled maintenance periods

### Dashboard & Reporting
- [ ] **Health Dashboard**: Real-time visual overview of all data source statuses
- [ ] **Historical Reports**: Weekly quality and performance trend analysis
- [ ] **SLA Tracking**: Monitor 99.5% uptime and quality SLA compliance
- [ ] **Issue Resolution Tracking**: Log and track mean time to resolution (MTTR)

### Integration & Operations
- [ ] **CLI Commands**: `busta sources health --watch` and `busta alerts list` for monitoring
- [ ] **REST API**: Endpoints for external monitoring system integration
- [ ] **YAML Configuration**: Alert rules following existing framework standards

## Technical Approach (Future)
- **Health Check Framework**: Lightweight async health checks every 5 minutes
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus-style metrics for monitoring integration
- **Alert Engine**: Rule-based alerting with configurable thresholds
- **Dashboard**: Web-based dashboard using existing UI framework

## Dependencies
- [ ] DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK (provides baseline quality metrics)

## Risk Assessment (Future Implementation)
- **Low Risk**: Monitoring-only functionality with no production impact
- **Timeline**: 3 story points (2-3 weeks)
- **Resources**: 1 backend engineer for implementation and testing
- **Mitigation**: Start with basic alerting, add sophistication iteratively

## Definition of Done (Future)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive testing
- [ ] Health dashboard shows real-time status for all data sources
- [ ] Alert system successfully detects and notifies on simulated failures
- [ ] Documentation updated for new CLI commands and API endpoints
- [ ] **Framework Integration**: Leverage existing DataSourceValidator and quality metrics

## Business Value (Future)
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Catch data source problems before they impact betting decisions
- **Improved Reliability**: Faster response to outages and quality degradation
- **SLA Compliance**: Monitor and maintain data quality agreements
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual monitoring and investigation time

## Risks (Future)
- **Alert Fatigue**: Too many alerts could desensitize operators
- **False Positives**: Incorrect alerts during normal variance in data quality
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Additional system resources for continuous monitoring

## Notes
- **Current Assessment**: 70%+ of RSS feeds working normally - monitoring not urgent
- **Trigger for Re-prioritization**: When feed failure rate exceeds 20% or adding new data sources
- **Existing Tools**: `busta pipeline report feeds` provides current health status
- Build on existing DataSourceValidator quality metrics from the framework
- Consider integration with external monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Implement gradual rollout with conservative alert thresholds initially
