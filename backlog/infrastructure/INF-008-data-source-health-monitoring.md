# INF-008 - Data Source Health Monitoring & Alerting

**Status**: New  
**Epic**: infrastructure  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK  

## User Story
**As a** data platform operator  
**I want** real-time monitoring and alerting for data source health  
**So that** I can quickly respond to data quality issues and source outages

## Background
The DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK provides quality metrics (92% overall score), but these are calculated during collection. We need continuous monitoring to detect issues proactively and alert on degraded performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Health Monitoring
- [ ] **Real-time Health Checks**: Periodic connectivity and response time monitoring
- [ ] **Quality Trend Analysis**: Track data quality metrics over time
- [ ] **Performance Baselines**: Establish normal operating ranges for each data source
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in data collection or quality

### Alerting System
- [ ] **Configurable Alerts**: Set thresholds for quality scores, response times, failure rates
- [ ] **Multi-channel Notifications**: Email, Slack, webhook support for different alert types
- [ ] **Alert Escalation**: Progressive escalation for critical issues
- [ ] **Alert Suppression**: Prevent alert spam during known maintenance windows

### Dashboard & Reporting
- [ ] **Health Dashboard**: Visual overview of all data source status
- [ ] **Historical Reports**: Quality and performance trends over time
- [ ] **SLA Tracking**: Monitor data source uptime and quality SLAs
- [ ] **Issue Resolution Tracking**: Log and track resolution of data source issues

### Integration
- [ ] **CLI Commands**: `busta sources health` and `busta sources alerts` for monitoring
- [ ] **API Integration**: REST endpoints for external monitoring systems
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: YAML-based alert configuration following framework standards
- [ ] **Framework Integration**: Leverage existing DataSourceValidator and quality metrics

## Technical Approach
- **Background Monitoring**: Scheduled health checks independent of data collection
- **Time Series Storage**: Store health metrics for trend analysis
- **Rule Engine**: Flexible alerting rules based on metrics thresholds and patterns
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)

## Business Value
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Catch data source problems before they impact betting decisions
- **Improved Reliability**: Faster response to outages and quality degradation
- **SLA Compliance**: Monitor and maintain data quality agreements
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual monitoring and investigation time

## Risks
- **Alert Fatigue**: Too many alerts could desensitize operators
- **False Positives**: Incorrect alerts during normal variance in data quality
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Additional system resources for continuous monitoring

## Notes
- Build on existing DataSourceValidator quality metrics from the framework
- Consider integration with external monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Implement gradual rollout with conservative alert thresholds initially
