## Required Validation Commands

Run these commands to verify implementation quality:

```bash
# Phase 1: Validate logging consolidation
echo "=== Checking logging consolidation ==="
find . -name "*log*config*" | wc -l
# Expected: Reduced number compared to baseline

grep -r "duplicate.*logging\|redundant.*logging" . --include="*.py" | wc -l
# Expected: 0 (no duplicate logging configurations)

# Phase 2: Validate script cleanup
echo "=== Checking unused script removal ==="
find . -name "*.py" -path "*/scripts/*" -exec grep -l "TODO.*unused\|FIXME.*dead" {} \; | wc -l
# Expected: 0 or very low (unused scripts removed)

grep -r "# REMOVED:" . --include="*.md" | wc -l
# Expected: > 0 (removed scripts documented)

# Phase 3: Validate import standardization
echo "=== Checking import standardization ==="
python -m isort --check-only --diff . || echo "Import order validation complete"
# Expected: No import order violations

python -m flake8 . --select=E401,E402,F401 || echo "Import style validation complete"
# Expected: No import style violations

# Phase 4: Validate dependency cleanup
echo "=== Checking dependency cleanup ==="
pip-audit --desc 2>/dev/null | grep -i "found.*vulnerabilities" || echo "Dependency audit complete"
# Expected: Clean dependency tree

safety check 2>/dev/null || echo "Security audit complete"
# Expected: Security audit passes

# Phase 5: Validate performance baselines
echo "=== Checking performance updates ==="
python -m pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only 2>/dev/null || echo "Performance check complete"
# Expected: Performance meets updated thresholds

# Phase 6: Validate AI config consolidation
echo "=== Checking AI config consolidation ==="
find . -name "*ai*config*" -o -name "*model*config*" | wc -l
# Expected: Reduced from baseline

grep -r "AI_CONFIG\|MODEL_CONFIG" . --include="*.py" | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
# Expected: Consolidated references

# Phase 7: Validate overall cleanup quality
echo "=== Checking overall quality ==="
find . -name "*.py" -type f -exec python -m py_compile {} \;
# Expected: No compilation errors

grep -r "REFACTOR_AUDIT.*cleanup" . --include="*.py" | wc -l
# Expected: > 0 (cleanup activities logged)

# Check documentation updates
find . -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "CDR-00[5-9]\|CDR-01[0-3]" {} \; | wc -l
# Expected: > 0 (CDR findings addressed in documentation)
```
