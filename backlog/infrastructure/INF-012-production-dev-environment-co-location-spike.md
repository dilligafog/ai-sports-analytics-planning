# INF-012: Production & Dev Environment Co-location Spike

## User Story
**As a** DevOps Engineer  
**I want** to explore strategies for running production and development environments on the same server  
**So that** I can determine if this approach provides cost benefits while maintaining proper isolation and security

## Business Value
- **Cost Optimization**: Potential reduction in infrastructure costs by consolidating environments
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilization of server capacity during off-peak hours
- **Simplified Management**: Single server to monitor and maintain
- **Development Velocity**: Faster testing and deployment cycles with shared resources

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Isolation Strategies**: Research and document 3+ approaches for environment separation (Docker, Kubernetes, VMs, etc.)
- [ ] **Security Assessment**: Evaluate security implications and compliance requirements for co-located environments
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Analyze CPU, memory, disk, and network resource allocation strategies
- [ ] **Deployment Automation**: Assess CI/CD pipeline modifications needed for environment separation
- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting**: Design monitoring approach to prevent production impact from dev activities
- [ ] **Backup & Recovery**: Evaluate backup strategies and disaster recovery implications
- [ ] **Cost Analysis**: Calculate potential savings vs. separate infrastructure costs
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Document operational risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] **Migration Plan**: Outline steps for implementing chosen approach if recommended

## Technical Considerations

### Environment Isolation Options
- **Container-based**: Docker containers with network isolation
- **Virtualization**: Lightweight VMs (KVM, VirtualBox) for complete separation
- **Namespace isolation**: Linux namespaces and cgroups for resource control
- **Process isolation**: Systemd slices and user separation

### Resource Allocation Strategies
- **Dynamic allocation**: CPU/memory limits based on workload patterns
- **Time-based scheduling**: Dev environment priority during business hours
- **Load balancing**: Production gets guaranteed resources, dev gets burst capacity
- **Storage isolation**: Separate disk partitions with quotas

### Security & Compliance
- **Network segmentation**: Firewall rules and VLAN separation
- **Access controls**: Separate user accounts and SSH keys
- **Data isolation**: Encrypted storage and access logging
- **Audit trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance

## Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: Docker Compose Multi-Environment
```
Production Environment:
- Dedicated containers for web, API, database
- Resource limits and reservations
- Production-grade logging and monitoring

Development Environment:
- Separate container stack
- Hot-reload development servers
- Development databases with test data
```

### Option 2: Kubernetes Single-Node Cluster
```
Namespaces:
- production: Resource guarantees, strict limits
- development: Burstable QoS, flexible scaling
- monitoring: Shared observability stack
```

### Option 3: Hybrid VM + Container Approach
```
Base VM: Production environment
Container Layer: Development environment
Shared Resources: Monitoring, backups, security tools
```

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Production stability could be impacted by dev activities
- **Medium Risk**: Resource contention during peak development periods
- **Low Risk**: Additional complexity in deployment and monitoring
- **Timeline**: 3 story points (2-3 weeks for research and prototyping)
- **Resources**: 1 DevOps engineer for research and proof-of-concept

## Success Metrics
- **Resource Utilization**: Target >80% server utilization across both environments
- **Incident Rate**: <5% increase in production incidents due to co-location
- **Cost Savings**: >30% reduction in infrastructure costs vs. separate servers
- **Deployment Time**: <10% increase in deployment complexity

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Research report completed with detailed findings
- [ ] Proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating chosen approach
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis with clear recommendations
- [ ] Security assessment and compliance review completed
- [ ] Implementation roadmap for production deployment
- [ ] Documentation for operations team on management procedures

## Follow-up Stories (if recommended)
- **INF-013**: Implement chosen co-location strategy
- **INF-014**: Enhanced monitoring for co-located environments
- **INF-015**: Automated resource allocation and scaling
- **SEC-001**: Security hardening for multi-tenant server
