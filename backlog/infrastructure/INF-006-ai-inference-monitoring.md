# AI Inference Performance Monitoring & Cost Optimization

## User Story

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring of AI inference performance and costs  
**So that** I can optimize the multi-tier AI architecture and control operational expenses

## Background

The AI_GENERATED_SALES_PITCH implementation introduced a sophisticated multi-tier inference architecture:
- Local Ollama integration (Llama 3.1 8B) for cost-effective inference
- Petals distributed inference for GPU deployment  
- Provider abstraction with failover capabilities
- Performance: 9.4s generation time, 1907 chars

This story focuses on adding monitoring, alerting, and cost optimization capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Track inference latency by provider (local, Petals, cloud APIs)
- [ ] Monitor success/failure rates for each AI provider
- [ ] Log generation time and output quality metrics
- [ ] Dashboard showing real-time AI system health

### Cost Tracking
- [ ] Cost attribution by AI provider (API calls, GPU usage, etc.)
- [ ] Daily/monthly cost reports and budget alerts
- [ ] Cost per inference calculation and trends
- [ ] ROI analysis comparing different provider tiers

### Optimization Features
- [ ] Automatic failover monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Provider selection optimization based on cost/performance
- [ ] Cache hit rate monitoring for AI-generated content
- [ ] Load balancing metrics across inference endpoints

### Alerting & Notification
- [ ] Alerts for AI system failures or degraded performance
- [ ] Cost threshold alerts (daily/monthly budgets)
- [ ] Provider availability monitoring with notifications
- [ ] Quality degradation detection and alerts

## Implementation Notes

**Technical Approach:**
- Integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure
- Leverage provider abstraction layer for consistent metrics
- Add instrumentation to all AI inference endpoints
- Use structured logging for cost analysis

**Metrics to Track:**
- Request volume and patterns
- Provider selection distribution  
- Cache effectiveness
- User satisfaction with AI content

## Success Metrics

- 100% visibility into AI inference costs and performance
- Reduce AI operational costs by 20% through optimization
- Achieve 99.5% uptime for AI services
- Alert resolution time < 5 minutes for critical issues

## Dependencies

- âœ… AI_GENERATED_SALES_PITCH (provides multi-tier AI infrastructure)
- Existing monitoring/alerting infrastructure
- Cost tracking systems integration

## Effort Estimate

**3 story points** - Medium-low complexity focusing on:
- Monitoring integration (40%)
- Dashboard and alerting setup (30%)
- Cost tracking implementation (30%)
