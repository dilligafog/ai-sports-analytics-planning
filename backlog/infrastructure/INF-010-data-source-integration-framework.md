feat: implement DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK - User Story: Data Source Integration Framework

âœ… DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK Story Complete

ðŸŽ¯ Core Features:
- [x] Standardized BaseDataSource abstract class with consistent interface
- [x] DataSourceMetadata schema with comprehensive source configuration  
- [x] Automated validation framework with quality metrics and business rules
- [x] Central registry system with discovery and factory patterns
- [x] CLI integration with full source management capabilities

ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:
- [x] BaseDataSource: Abstract interface for all data collectors
- [x] DataSourceValidator: Quality checks, completeness, consistency validation
- [x] DataSourceRegistry: Central registration with @register_data_source decorator
- [x] DataSourceFactory: Instance creation and lifecycle management
- [x] CLI module: Rich interface for list|info|validate|collect operations
- [x] Framework integration: Full busta CLI integration with `busta sources`

ðŸ“Š Quality & Validation:
- [x] Comprehensive quality metrics (completeness, consistency, validity, uniqueness, timeliness)
- [x] Structured validation results with severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- [x] Connection health checks and authentication validation
- [x] Automated metadata tracking with collection timestamps and lineage

ðŸ”Œ Integration & Migration:
- [x] Discovery system for automatic source registration
- [x] Migration patterns for existing collectors (example with AdvancedStatsCollector)
- [x] Standardized data flow: Raw â†’ Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layer support
- [x] Framework examples and comprehensive documentation

ðŸ“Š Testing & Quality:
- [x] All CLI commands functional and tested âœ“
- [x] Example data source demonstrates full collection cycle
- [x] Quality metrics show 92% overall score with detailed breakdown
- [x] Integration tests validate framework functionality
- [x] Rich CLI output with tables, panels, and progress indicators

ðŸ’¡ Additional Notes:
- Enables rapid addition of new data sources without core pipeline changes
- Provides consistent data quality monitoring across all sources  
- Supports both API and file-based data source integration patterns
- Framework designed for extensibility with future parallel collection and advanced monitoring
- Documentation includes migration guide and best practices for adoption

```
