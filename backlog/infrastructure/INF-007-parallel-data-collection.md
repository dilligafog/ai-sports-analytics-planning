# INF-007: Parallel Data Collection Engine

## User Story
**As a** Data Platform Operator  
**I want** parallel data collection across multiple sources  
**So that** data ingestion is faster and more efficient during peak collection windows

## Business Value
- **3-5x faster data ingestion** through concurrent processing
- **Better resource utilization** during collection windows
- **Improved user experience** with faster data availability
- **Scalable foundation** for handling additional data sources

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Parallel Collection
- [ ] **Concurrent Collection Manager**: Orchestrate multiple data sources simultaneously
- [ ] **Resource Pool Management**: Limit concurrent connections per source type (max 5 per API, 10 for RSS)
- [ ] **Priority-based Scheduling**: High-priority sources get precedence during resource contention
- [ ] **Failure Isolation**: One source failure doesn't impact other collections

### Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] **Collection Metrics**: Track parallel collection performance and bottlenecks
- [ ] **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage during parallel operations
- [ ] **Collection Time Optimization**: Automatic scheduling based on source response times
- [ ] **Smart Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed collections (max 3 retries)

### Integration & Operations
- [ ] **CLI Enhancement**: `busta sources collect --parallel --concurrency 8` command
- [ ] **Configuration**: YAML-based concurrency limits per source type and globally
- [ ] **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of parallel operations and performance metrics
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing sequential collection remains functional

## Technical Approach
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Python asyncio for concurrent data collection
- **Resource Pools**: Connection limits per data source type (APIs: 5, RSS: 10, Files: 20)
- **Priority Queue**: Fair scheduling with priority-based collection queue
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for concurrent operations

## Dependencies
- [ ] DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK (must be completed first)

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Async complexity and resource management
- **Timeline**: 5 story points (3-4 weeks)
- **Resources**: 1 backend engineer with async experience
- **Mitigation**: Start with small concurrency limits, extensive testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show 3x+ improvement
- [ ] No regressions in existing sequential collection
- [ ] Documentation updated for new CLI commands
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show parallel collection metrics
- **API Rate Limits**: Need careful management of external API limitations
- **Complexity**: More complex error handling and debugging

## Notes
- Build on the BaseDataSource interface from DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK
- Consider implementing as an optional enhancement to existing sequential collection
- Monitor external API rate limits and implement intelligent throttling
