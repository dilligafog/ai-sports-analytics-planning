# INF-007 - Parallel Data Collection Engine

**Status**: New  
**Epic**: infrastructure  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK  

## User Story
**As a** data platform operator  
**I want** parallel data collection across multiple sources  
**So that** data ingestion is faster and more efficient during peak collection windows

## Background
The DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK provides a solid foundation for data source management, but currently processes sources sequentially. With multiple data sources (Kaggle, APIs, RSS feeds, etc.), parallel collection would significantly improve performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Parallel Collection
- [ ] **Concurrent Collection Manager**: Orchestrate multiple data sources simultaneously
- [ ] **Resource Pool Management**: Limit concurrent connections per source type
- [ ] **Priority-based Scheduling**: High-priority sources get precedence during resource contention
- [ ] **Failure Isolation**: One source failure doesn't impact other collections

### Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] **Collection Metrics**: Track parallel collection performance and bottlenecks
- [ ] **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage during parallel operations
- [ ] **Collection Time Optimization**: Automatic scheduling based on source response times
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Smart retry with exponential backoff for failed collections

### Integration
- [ ] **CLI Enhancement**: `busta sources collect --parallel` with concurrency controls
- [ ] **Configuration**: Configurable concurrency limits per source type and globally
- [ ] **Logging**: Detailed logging of parallel collection operations and performance
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing sequential collection still works

## Technical Approach
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Use Python asyncio for concurrent data collection
- **Resource Pools**: Manage connection limits per data source type
- **Queue System**: Priority-based collection queue with fair scheduling
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for multiple concurrent operations

## Business Value
- **Faster Data Ingestion**: 3-5x improvement in total collection time
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Maximize throughput during collection windows
- **Improved User Experience**: Faster data availability for analysis and betting decisions
- **Scalability**: Foundation for handling additional data sources without linear time increase

## Risks
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Too many concurrent operations could overwhelm systems
- **API Rate Limits**: Need careful management of external API limitations
- **Complexity**: More complex error handling and debugging

## Notes
- Build on the BaseDataSource interface from DATA_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_FRAMEWORK
- Consider implementing as an optional enhancement to existing sequential collection
- Monitor external API rate limits and implement intelligent throttling
