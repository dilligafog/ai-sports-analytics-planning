# CCU-003: Complete Future Annotations Implementation

## Background
Following the pattern established in CDR-001 through CDR-004, we need to complete adding `from __future__ import annotations` to any remaining files that don't have it yet. The initial implementation covered test files and some core files, but a comprehensive sweep may be needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify all Python files missing future annotations import
- [ ] Add `from __future__ import annotations` as first line to all identified files
- [ ] Preserve existing import structure and spacing
- [ ] Validate syntax for all modified files
- [ ] Follow established pattern from CDR-001 implementation
- [ ] No functional changes to existing code logic

## Implementation Details

### File Categories to Check
- [ ] Remaining test files not covered in CDR-001
- [ ] Core package files not covered in CDR-004
- [ ] Script files and utilities
- [ ] Any new files added since CDR-001 completion

### Implementation Pattern (from CDR-001)
```python
# Before:
from some_module import something

# After:
from __future__ import annotations

from some_module import something
```

### Validation Steps
- [ ] Syntax validation with `python -m py_compile`
- [ ] AST parsing confirms valid Python syntax
- [ ] Future annotations import detected as first import (line 1)
- [ ] Import order follows project standards

## Technical Details
- Use established pattern from CDR-001 implementation
- Focus on files that don't already have the import
- Maintain existing code structure and formatting
- Batch process for efficiency

## Risk Assessment
- **Very Low Risk**: Simple import addition only
- **No Breaking Changes**: Code functionality unchanged
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows pattern from existing codebase files
