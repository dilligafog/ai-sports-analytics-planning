# User Story: Scheduling & Automation

## Overview
**As a** data engineer  
**I want** automated, scheduled data collection  
**So that** the system consistently has fresh data without manual intervention

## Value Proposition
Ensures data reliability and freshness by automating collection at appropriate intervals. This reduces manual effort, prevents data gaps, and maintains consistent data quality for downstream processes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System automatically collects data from all sources on appropriate schedules
- Collection jobs are logged with success/failure status
- Failed jobs trigger notifications
- Log rotation prevents excessive disk usage

## Technical Requirements
- Implement cron jobs or scheduling system to run `busta collect` commands
- Create a logging system that captures run details
- Implement log rotation and archiving
- Develop failure notification system

## Implementation Plan
1. Define appropriate collection schedules for each data source
2. Implement scheduling mechanism (cron jobs or scheduler)
3. Create logging infrastructure with rotation
4. Develop monitoring and notification system
5. Test automated collection over multiple cycles

## Definition of Done
- Scheduled pulls successfully execute for all data sources
- Logs capture collection details and rotate appropriately
- System detects and notifies on collection failures
- No manual intervention required for normal operation

## Related Features
- Data Sources Implementation (dependency)
- Unified CLI (dependency)
