# CCU-003 Code Review Request: Future Annotations Implementation

## Review Context
**AI Agent Implementation**: Review code written by AI agent following the enhanced acceptance criteria and implementation algorithm specified in CCU-003.

**Story Summary**: Complete implementation of `from __future__ import annotations` across all Python files missing this import, following established CDR-001 patterns.

## Story-Specific Review Checklist

### ✅ Functional Requirements Validation
- [ ] **File discovery and analysis complete**
  - [ ] All Python files (.py) scanned recursively in codebase
  - [ ] Files missing `from __future__ import annotations` correctly identified
  - [ ] Python < 3.7 compatibility files properly excluded
  - [ ] Modification report generated before changes made

- [ ] **Future annotations implementation correct**
  - [ ] Import added as very first import line in all target files
  - [ ] Exactly one blank line maintained after future import
  - [ ] All existing import structure, order, and spacing preserved
  - [ ] Edge cases handled: docstrings, comments, encoding declarations

- [ ] **Code structure preservation verified**
  - [ ] File encoding declarations preserved (# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-)
  - [ ] Module docstrings remain in correct position (after future imports)
  - [ ] Existing import grouping maintained (standard, third-party, local)
  - [ ] Any existing `# noqa` or type ignore comments preserved

### ✅ Technical Requirements Validation
- [ ] **File categorization systematic**
  - [ ] Test files processed (`test_*.py`, `*_test.py`)
  - [ ] Core package files processed (`src/`, `lib/`, main packages)
  - [ ] Utility and script files processed (`scripts/`, `bin/`, `tools/`)
  - [ ] Configuration files processed (`setup.py`, `conftest.py`)

- [ ] **Implementation consistency verified**
  - [ ] Exact pattern from CDR-001 implementation followed
  - [ ] Consistent spacing and formatting across all files
  - [ ] Project's import ordering standards maintained
  - [ ] No duplicate future imports created

### ✅ AI Implementation Quality Check
- [ ] **Algorithm implementation correct**
  - [ ] File discovery strategy properly implemented
  - [ ] AST parsing logic correctly identifies insertion points
  - [ ] All file structure patterns handled (shebang, encoding, docstrings)
  - [ ] Implementation algorithm follows provided Python code exactly

- [ ] **Pattern recognition accurate**
  - [ ] Existing future annotations imports detected and skipped
  - [ ] Empty files and comment-only files handled appropriately
  - [ ] Complex file structures parsed correctly
  - [ ] No files inappropriately modified

## Required Validation Commands

Run these commands to verify implementation quality:

```bash
# Verify future annotations were added to appropriate files
grep -r "from __future__ import annotations" . --include="*.py" | wc -l
# Expected: > 0, significant number of files updated

# Check no duplicate future imports created
grep -r "from __future__ import annotations" . --include="*.py" | \
  cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -d | wc -l
# Expected: 0 (no duplicate imports)

# Validate all Python files compile correctly
find . -name "*.py" -type f -exec python -m py_compile {} \;
# Expected: No compilation errors

# Check syntax of all Python files
python -m compileall . -q
# Expected: Success (no syntax errors)

# Verify proper import placement (after encoding/docstring)
grep -A5 -B5 "from __future__ import annotations" . --include="*.py" | head -20
# Expected: Proper placement relative to encoding and docstrings

# Check no unintended whitespace changes
git diff --check
# Expected: No whitespace errors introduced

# Verify import ordering compliance (if using isort)
python -m isort --check-only --diff . || echo "Import order check complete"
# Expected: No import order violations

# Count files that still need future annotations (should be minimal)
find . -name "*.py" -type f | xargs grep -L "from __future__ import annotations" | \
  grep -v __pycache__ | wc -l
# Expected: Very low number (only files that should be excluded)
```

## Quality Assurance Validation
- [ ] **Syntax and compatibility verified**
  - [ ] Python syntax validated for all modified files using `python -m py_compile`
  - [ ] Future annotations import detected as first import
  - [ ] No duplicate future annotations imports created
  - [ ] Type hints still work correctly after modification

- [ ] **Edge case handling verified**
  - [ ] Files with existing `__future__` imports handled correctly (no duplicates)
  - [ ] Files with Python version compatibility requirements skipped
  - [ ] Complex encoding declarations processed correctly
  - [ ] Empty files and comment-only files handled appropriately

## File Structure Validation
- [ ] **Insertion point accuracy**
  - [ ] Shebang lines (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) properly preserved
  - [ ] Encoding declarations (`# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`) maintained
  - [ ] Module docstrings remain after future imports
  - [ ] Import grouping and ordering preserved

- [ ] **Change tracking complete**
  - [ ] All modified files documented with line counts
  - [ ] Any skipped files documented with reasons
  - [ ] No functional code changes beyond import addition
  - [ ] Git diff shows only expected import additions

## Review Completion Criteria
✅ **Pass Criteria**: All Python files have future annotations, no syntax errors, proper placement, no duplicates, all validation commands pass

❌ **Fail Criteria**: Syntax errors, improper placement, duplicates, missing files, or validation command failures

## Required Review Response Format

**IMPORTANT**: The reviewer must respond with one of the following formats:

### For Approval:
```
APPROVE_MERGE

All acceptance criteria validated successfully:
- [✅] Future annotations added to all appropriate Python files
- [✅] No syntax errors introduced (compilation successful)
- [✅] Proper import placement (after encoding/docstrings)
- [✅] No duplicate future imports created
- [✅] All validation commands pass
- [✅] File structure and formatting preserved

Implementation meets all story requirements. Ready to proceed to CCU-004.
```

### For Requested Changes:
```
CHANGES_REQUESTED

The following issues must be addressed before approval:

1. **Syntax Errors**: [specific files with compilation errors]
2. **Improper Placement**: [specific files with incorrect import placement]
3. **Duplicate Imports**: [specific files with duplicate future annotations]
4. **Missing Files**: [specific Python files still missing future annotations]
5. **Validation Failures**: [specific validation commands that failed]

Please address these issues and resubmit for review.
```

## Post-Review Actions
- [ ] If **APPROVE_MERGE**: Proceed to CCU-004 implementation
- [ ] If **CHANGES_REQUESTED**: Document specific files/issues and request AI agent corrections
- [ ] Update coding standards documentation if needed
- [ ] Ensure future annotations are part of new file templates
