# CCU-001: Implement Enhanced Logging for Migration Audit Trail

## Background
Following the human decision in HUM-CDR-016, we need to implement basic logging enhancement for migration audit trails. This leverages existing component logging infrastructure rather than adding complex monitoring tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **REFACTOR_AUDIT logging pattern**: Implement standardized `REFACTOR_AUDIT` prefix in all migration-related log messages
  - [ ] All migration scripts use `get_component_logger(__name__)` from existing infrastructure
  - [ ] Log messages follow format: `REFACTOR_AUDIT: [action] [details]`
  - [ ] Minimum log level set to INFO for audit messages

- [ ] **Config migration tracking**: Complete lifecycle logging for configuration file migrations
  - [ ] Log migration start with filename, timestamp, and source/target paths
  - [ ] Log migration completion with success/failure status and duration
  - [ ] Log any configuration validation errors with specific field names
  - [ ] Include file size and modification timestamps in migration logs

- [ ] **Package-level migration status**: Track package transition progress
  - [ ] Log package migration initiation with package name and version
  - [ ] Log successful package migrations with import test results
  - [ ] Log failed package migrations with specific error details
  - [ ] Track dependency resolution during package transitions

- [ ] **Import validation logging**: Comprehensive validation tracking
  - [ ] Log pre-migration import baseline (what currently works)
  - [ ] Log post-migration import tests with pass/fail status
  - [ ] Log specific import errors with module names and error types
  - [ ] Include performance metrics (import time before/after)

- [ ] **Enhanced error context**: Detailed error reporting during refactoring
  - [ ] Include stack traces for migration failures
  - [ ] Log file paths, line numbers, and code snippets for syntax errors
  - [ ] Include system context (Python version, environment variables)
  - [ ] Log rollback actions when migrations fail

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Audit trail accessibility**: Logs must be easily searchable and reviewable
  - [ ] All audit logs written to `/logs/migration_audit.log` with rotation
  - [ ] Implement consistent timestamp format (ISO 8601)
  - [ ] Ensure logs are grep-able with `grep "REFACTOR_AUDIT"` command
  - [ ] Include structured data (JSON) for complex migration events

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Log output verification**: Validate logging functionality
  - [ ] Unit tests verify correct log messages are generated
  - [ ] Integration tests confirm logs are written to correct files
  - [ ] Test log rotation and file size management
  - [ ] Verify log format consistency across all migration scripts

- [ ] **Audit trail completeness**: Ensure comprehensive coverage
  - [ ] Manual test: Run complete migration and verify all steps are logged
  - [ ] Verify log entries can reconstruct migration timeline
  - [ ] Test log readability for troubleshooting scenarios
  - [ ] Validate grep patterns work for common search scenarios

### Performance & Security
- [ ] **Performance impact**: Logging must not significantly slow migrations
  - [ ] Logging overhead < 5% of total migration time
  - [ ] Asynchronous logging for non-critical audit messages
  - [ ] Log file I/O optimized for minimal blocking

- [ ] **Security considerations**: Protect sensitive information in logs
  - [ ] No credentials or API keys in log messages
  - [ ] Sanitize file paths to avoid exposing sensitive directory structures
  - [ ] Ensure log files have appropriate permissions (600)

## Implementation Details

### AI Agent Implementation Notes
**This task is suitable for automated implementation** - it involves well-defined code patterns and logging enhancements without complex business logic decisions.

### Enhanced Logging Pattern
```python
from nfl_data_pipeline.logging_config import get_component_logger
logger = get_component_logger(__name__)

# Add refactoring audit trails with consistent format
logger.info("REFACTOR_AUDIT: Config migration started for %s", filename)
logger.info("REFACTOR_AUDIT: Config migration completed for %s (duration: %0.2fs)", filename, duration)
logger.info("REFACTOR_AUDIT: Package validation passed for %s", package_name)
logger.error("REFACTOR_AUDIT: Migration failed for %s - %s", filename, error_message)
```

### File Discovery Strategy for AI Agent
1. **Migration Scripts Location**: Look for files in:
   - `/scripts/migration/` directories
   - Files with `migrate`, `refactor`, or `transition` in the name
   - Python files importing configuration or package management modules

2. **Configuration Files**: Target files containing:
   - `config.py`, `settings.py`, `__init__.py` files
   - YAML/JSON configuration files being migrated
   - Package dependency files (`requirements.txt`, `setup.py`)

### Implementation Checklist for AI Agent
- [ ] Scan codebase for existing migration-related files
- [ ] Identify current logging patterns to maintain consistency
- [ ] Add REFACTOR_AUDIT logging to all migration functions
- [ ] Create/update `/logs/migration_audit.log` configuration
- [ ] Add unit tests for new logging functionality
- [ ] Update existing tests to expect new log messages

### Monitoring Scope
- **Config Migration**: Log each file migration start/complete
- **Package Transitions**: Log package-level migration status
- **Import Validation**: Log successful/failed import tests
- **Error Patterns**: Enhanced error context during refactoring

## Technical Details
- Use existing component logging pattern from coding standards
- Leverage established `/logs/` directory infrastructure
- No new monitoring tools or dependencies required
- Simple grep-able audit trail for easy review

### AI Agent Success Criteria
- **Pattern Recognition**: Agent should identify migration functions by keywords and imports
- **Consistent Implementation**: Follow established logging patterns without introducing new dependencies
- **Non-Breaking Changes**: Only add logging statements, no functional modifications
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure all new logging is covered by unit tests

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Only adds logging, no functional changes
- **Leverages Existing**: Uses proven logging infrastructure
- **Easy Rollback**: Can remove audit logs if needed
- **AI-Friendly**: Well-defined patterns suitable for automated implementation
