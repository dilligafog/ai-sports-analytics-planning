# CCU-001: Implement Enhanced Logging for Migration Audit Trail

## Background
Following the human decision in HUM-CDR-016, we need to implement basic logging enhancement for migration audit trails. This leverages existing component logging infrastructure rather than adding complex monitoring tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] REFACTOR_AUDIT logging pattern implemented in migration scripts
- [ ] Config migration start/complete events logged
- [ ] Package-level migration status logged
- [ ] Import validation success/failure logged
- [ ] Enhanced error context during refactoring
- [ ] Audit trail easily grep-able for review

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Logging Pattern
```python
from nfl_data_pipeline.logging_config import get_component_logger
logger = get_component_logger(__name__)

# Add refactoring audit trails
logger.info("REFACTOR_AUDIT: Config migration started for %s", filename)
logger.info("REFACTOR_AUDIT: Config migration completed for %s", filename)
logger.info("REFACTOR_AUDIT: Validation passed for %s", package_name)
```

### Monitoring Scope
- **Config Migration**: Log each file migration start/complete
- **Package Transitions**: Log package-level migration status
- **Import Validation**: Log successful/failed import tests
- **Error Patterns**: Enhanced error context during refactoring

## Technical Details
- Use existing component logging pattern from coding standards
- Leverage established `/logs/` directory infrastructure
- No new monitoring tools or dependencies required
- Simple grep-able audit trail for easy review

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Only adds logging, no functional changes
- **Leverages Existing**: Uses proven logging infrastructure
- **Easy Rollback**: Can remove audit logs if needed
