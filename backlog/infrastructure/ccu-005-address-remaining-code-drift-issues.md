# CCU-005: Address Remaining Code Drift Issues

## Background
Based on the comprehensive analysis in CDR-005 through CDR-013, there are several remaining code drift issues that need to be addressed. This includes logging config duplication, unused script functionality, and other technical debt items identified during the review.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Address logging config duplication (CDR-007)
- [ ] Clean up unused script functionality (CDR-009)
- [ ] Resolve any remaining import inconsistencies
- [ ] Update performance baselines (CDR-013)
- [ ] Validate package dependencies (CDR-011)
- [ ] Address AI config duplication (CDR-012)
- [ ] Document any architectural decisions made

## Implementation Details

### Key Areas from CDR Analysis
- **Logging Consolidation**: Merge duplicate logging configurations
- **Script Cleanup**: Remove or refactor unused script functionality
- **Import Standardization**: Ensure consistent import patterns
- **Performance Documentation**: Update baselines from CDR-013
- **Dependency Validation**: Clean up package dependencies per CDR-011

### Implementation Approach
- [ ] Review CDR-005 through CDR-013 findings
- [ ] Prioritize based on risk and impact assessment
- [ ] Implement changes following established patterns
- [ ] Add appropriate logging and validation
- [ ] Document any architectural decisions

## Technical Details
- Follow patterns established in earlier CDR implementations
- Use REFACTOR_AUDIT logging for tracking changes
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Update documentation as needed

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Addresses multiple technical debt items
- **Mitigation**: Implement incrementally with validation
- **Rollback**: Most changes can be easily reverted
- **Testing**: Use critical path tests from CCU-002
