# CCU-002: Add Critical Path Tests for Config Migration

## Background
Following the human decision in HUM-CDR-014, we need to add critical path tests only (not comprehensive coverage). Focus on the highest risk areas identified in CDR-005 findings, specifically config migration files.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Config loading/validation tests**: Comprehensive testing for migrated configuration files
  - [ ] Test successful loading of all 26 high-risk config migration files
  - [ ] Validate config schema compatibility between V1 and V2 systems
  - [ ] Test config object instantiation with both old and new patterns
  - [ ] Verify configuration validation rules work correctly post-migration

- [ ] **Import compatibility tests**: Ensure seamless transition between config systems
  - [ ] Test V1 import patterns continue to work after migration
  - [ ] Test V2 import patterns work correctly with migrated configs
  - [ ] Validate backward compatibility for existing config consumers
  - [ ] Test cross-system config sharing scenarios

- [ ] **Critical path smoke tests**: Essential functionality validation
  - [ ] Test application startup with migrated configs
  - [ ] Test config-dependent core functionality (data loading, processing)
  - [ ] Test environment-specific config variations (dev, prod, test)
  - [ ] Validate config override mechanisms still function

- [ ] **Migration-specific tests**: Focus on 26 highest-risk config files
  - [ ] Test each of the 26 identified config files individually
  - [ ] Validate path resolution (pathlib.Path vs string paths)
  - [ ] Test nested vs flat configuration access patterns
  - [ ] Verify attribute access compatibility between old/new structures

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Error context and debugging**: Clear failure information
  - [ ] Test failures include specific config file names and line numbers
  - [ ] Include expected vs actual configuration values in failure messages
  - [ ] Provide stack traces for import/loading failures
  - [ ] Log configuration differences when compatibility tests fail

- [ ] **Test infrastructure integration**: Seamless CI/CD integration
  - [ ] Tests use existing pytest framework and conventions
  - [ ] Tests run in under 30 seconds for CI efficiency
  - [ ] Tests are isolated and don't depend on external resources
  - [ ] Test fixtures reuse existing test data where possible

### Testing Scope & Coverage
- [ ] **Config file coverage**: Target the highest-risk areas
  - [ ] All 26 config files from CDR-005 analysis have dedicated tests
  - [ ] Test both successful migration scenarios and edge cases
  - [ ] Include tests for config files with complex nested structures
  - [ ] Test config files with environment-specific variations

- [ ] **Compatibility matrix testing**: Cross-version validation
  - [ ] Test V1 config loading with V2 system components
  - [ ] Test V2 config loading with legacy V1 components
  - [ ] Validate mixed-mode scenarios (partially migrated systems)
  - [ ] Test rollback scenarios (V2 → V1 compatibility)

### Validation & Quality
- [ ] **Test reliability**: Consistent and deterministic results
  - [ ] Tests pass consistently across different environments
  - [ ] No flaky tests that pass/fail intermittently
  - [ ] Tests are independent and can run in any order
  - [ ] Test data is deterministic and reproducible

- [ ] **Performance requirements**: Fast execution for CI integration
  - [ ] Individual test execution time < 1 second
  - [ ] Total test suite execution time < 30 seconds
  - [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable for CI environments
  - [ ] Tests clean up resources properly after execution

## Implementation Details

### AI Agent Implementation Notes
**This task is suitable for automated implementation** - it involves creating structured test patterns based on existing code and well-defined testing frameworks.

### Testing Scope (Based on CDR-005 Analysis)
```bash
# Focus areas:
# 1. Config migration (26 files) - HIGH risk
# 2. Import compatibility between V1/V2 systems
# 3. Basic smoke tests for critical paths
```

### File Discovery Strategy for AI Agent
1. **Config Files Location**: Look for files in:
   - `config/`, `configs/`, `settings/` directories
   - Files named `config.py`, `settings.py`, `__init__.py`
   - YAML/JSON configuration files (`.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json`)
   - Files containing `CONFIG`, `SETTINGS`, or `PARAMETERS` constants

2. **Migration Files**: Target files containing:
   - Import statements from old config modules
   - Path handling with `pathlib.Path` or `os.path`
   - Configuration class definitions
   - Environment-specific config variations

### Test Structure Templates
```python
# Config Loading Test Template
def test_config_migration_loading_{filename}():
    """Test that {filename} loads correctly after migration."""
    from {module_path} import {config_class}
    
    # Test successful instantiation
    config = {config_class}()
    assert config is not None
    
    # Test required attributes exist
    assert hasattr(config, 'expected_attribute')
    
    # Test compatibility with existing consumers
    # Add specific validation based on config structure

# Import Compatibility Test Template  
def test_import_compatibility_{module_name}():
    """Test V1/V2 import compatibility for {module_name}."""
    # Test old import pattern still works
    try:
        from old.module.path import ConfigClass as OldConfig
        old_config = OldConfig()
    except ImportError as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Old import pattern failed: {e}")
    
    # Test new import pattern works
    try:
        from new.module.path import ConfigClass as NewConfig
        new_config = NewConfig()
    except ImportError as e:
        pytest.fail(f"New import pattern failed: {e}")
    
    # Test compatibility between old and new
    assert type(old_config.some_attr) == type(new_config.some_attr)

# Critical Path Smoke Test Template
def test_critical_path_{functionality}():
    """Smoke test for {functionality} with migrated config."""
    # Test application can start with new config
    # Test core functionality works
    # Test environment variations
    pass
```

### Implementation Checklist for AI Agent
- [ ] Scan codebase for config-related files using discovery strategy
- [ ] Identify the 26 high-risk config files from CDR-005 analysis
- [ ] Create test files following pytest conventions (`test_*.py`)
- [ ] Generate tests using provided templates for each config file
- [ ] Add import compatibility tests for V1/V2 transitions
- [ ] Create smoke tests for critical application paths
- [ ] Ensure all tests integrate with existing pytest infrastructure

### Test Categories
- **Config Loading Tests**: Validate config objects load correctly
- **Import Compatibility Tests**: Ensure V1/V2 compatibility patterns work
- **Path Resolution Tests**: Validate pathlib.Path vs string path handling
- **Attribute Access Tests**: Test nested vs flat configuration access

### Test Structure
```python
# Example test pattern
def test_config_migration_compatibility():
    """Test that migrated config maintains compatibility."""
    # Test V1 → V2 migration preserves expected attributes
    # Test path handling differences
    # Test nested vs flat access patterns
```

## Technical Details
- Use existing pytest infrastructure
- Follow established testing patterns from coding standards
- Focus on validation rather than comprehensive coverage
- Tests should be fast and reliable for CI integration

### AI Agent Success Criteria
- **Pattern Recognition**: Agent should identify config files by naming patterns and imports
- **Test Generation**: Create focused tests based on provided templates
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure V1/V2 compatibility is validated
- **Performance Aware**: Keep tests fast and CI-friendly (< 30 seconds total)

### Testing Framework Requirements
- Use `pytest` framework with existing fixtures
- Follow naming convention: `test_config_migration_*.py`
- Place tests in appropriate test directories alongside existing tests
- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for testing multiple config files efficiently

### Validation Strategy
```python
# Example validation pattern for AI to follow
@pytest.mark.parametrize("config_file", [
    "config/database.py",
    "config/api_settings.py", 
    # ... other 24 high-risk files
])
def test_config_migration_compatibility(config_file):
    """Test config migration compatibility for each high-risk file."""
    # Load config using both old and new patterns
    # Validate structure compatibility
    # Test attribute access patterns
```

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Only adds tests, doesn't change production code
- **Focused Scope**: Only critical paths per HUM-CDR-014 decision
- **Incremental**: Can add more tests later if needed
- **AI-Friendly**: Well-defined test patterns suitable for automated generation
