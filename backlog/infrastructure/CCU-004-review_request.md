# CCU-004 Code Review Request: Package-by-Package Config Migration

## Review Context
**AI Agent Implementation**: Review code written by AI agent following the enhanced acceptance criteria and phased migration strategy specified in CCU-004.

**Story Summary**: Implement systematic package-by-package migration from config.py to config_v2.py following CDR-005 dependency order with comprehensive validation.

## Story-Specific Review Checklist

### ✅ Validation and Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Package-specific smoke tests comprehensive**
  - [ ] Smoke test suite created for each migrated package
  - [ ] Core functionality tested with both old and new config patterns
  - [ ] Configuration loading and parsing validated for each package
  - [ ] Error handling and edge cases tested

- [ ] **Integration testing complete**
  - [ ] Interactions between migrated and non-migrated packages tested
  - [ ] Data flow validated between packages during partial migration
  - [ ] Configuration inheritance and override patterns tested
  - [ ] Environment-specific configuration handling verified

## Required Validation Commands

Run these commands to verify implementation quality:

```bash
# Phase 1: Verify migration sequence compliance
echo "=== Checking migration order compliance ==="
# Core config should be migrated first
grep -r "config_v2" . --include="*/config/*" | wc -l
# Expected: > 0, core config migrated

# Phase 2: Verify import pattern updates
echo "=== Checking import pattern migration ==="
grep -r "from nfl_data_pipeline.config import" . --include="*.py" | grep -v config_v2 | wc -l
# Expected: 0 or very low (only compatibility shims)

grep -r "from nfl_data_pipeline.config_v2 import" . --include="*.py" | wc -l
# Expected: > 0, new imports implemented

# Phase 3: Verify variable naming migration
echo "=== Checking variable naming consistency ==="
grep -r "\bsettings\b" . --include="*.py" | grep -v "django.conf.settings" | \
  grep -v "test_settings" | grep -v "import.*settings" | wc -l
# Expected: Low number (only legitimate non-config settings)

grep -r "\bconfig\b" . --include="*.py" | grep -v "import.*config" | wc -l
# Expected: > previous settings count

# Phase 4: Verify package-specific implementation
echo "=== Checking package coverage ==="
# Core package
find . -path "*/nfl_data_pipeline/config*" -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "config_v2" {} \;
# Expected: Core files using config_v2

# Data pipeline package
find . -path "*/data_pipeline/*" -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "config_v2" {} \; | wc -l
# Expected: > 0, data pipeline migrated

# Models package
find . -path "*/models/*" -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "config_v2" {} \; | wc -l
# Expected: > 0, models migrated

# Scripts package
find . -path "*/scripts/*" -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "config_v2" {} \; | wc -l
# Expected: > 0, scripts migrated

# Phase 5: Verify REFACTOR_AUDIT logging
echo "=== Checking migration audit logging ==="
grep -r "REFACTOR_AUDIT.*migration" . --include="*.py" | wc -l
# Expected: > 0, migration events logged

# Phase 6: Validate syntax and functionality
echo "=== Validating implementation quality ==="
find . -name "*.py" -type f -exec python -m py_compile {} \;
# Expected: No compilation errors

# Run package smoke tests
python -m pytest tests/smoke/ -k "package_migration" -v || echo "Smoke tests check complete"
# Expected: All package migrations validated
```

## AI Implementation Quality Check
- [ ] **Migration algorithm implementation correct**
  - [ ] Package discovery strategy properly implemented
  - [ ] File analysis correctly identifies config usage patterns
  - [ ] Migration patterns applied consistently across all files
  - [ ] REFACTOR_AUDIT logging added for all changes

- [ ] **Phase implementation systematic**
  - [ ] Phase 1 (Core config) completed before Phase 2
  - [ ] Phase 2 (Data pipeline) completed before Phase 3
  - [ ] Phase 3 (Models) completed before Phase 4
  - [ ] Phase 4 (Scripts) completed with full validation

## Rollback and Safety Validation
- [ ] **Rollback capability verified**
  - [ ] Each package can be independently rolled back
  - [ ] Backup procedures documented and tested
  - [ ] Package boundaries respected for isolated rollbacks
  - [ ] Migration state tracking implemented

- [ ] **Compatibility preservation verified**
  - [ ] Dual repo sync validation completed
  - [ ] Configuration compatibility across environments
  - [ ] Gradual migration support maintained
  - [ ] No breaking changes for unmigrated components

## Review Completion Criteria
✅ **Pass Criteria**: All 4 phases completed in order, import patterns updated, variable naming consistent, smoke tests pass, audit logging implemented

❌ **Fail Criteria**: Phase order violated, incomplete migrations, syntax errors, compatibility issues, or validation failures

## Required Review Response Format

**IMPORTANT**: The reviewer must respond with one of the following formats:

### For Approval:
```
APPROVE_MERGE

All acceptance criteria validated successfully:
- [✅] All 4 migration phases completed in correct dependency order
- [✅] Import patterns updated (config → config_v2) throughout codebase
- [✅] Variable naming migrated (settings → config) consistently
- [✅] Package-specific smoke tests pass for all migrated packages
- [✅] REFACTOR_AUDIT logging implemented for all changes
- [✅] All validation commands pass

Implementation meets all story requirements. Ready to proceed to CCU-005.
```

### For Requested Changes:
```

The following issues must be addressed before approval:

1. **Phase Order Violations**: [specific dependency order issues]
2. **Incomplete Migrations**: [specific packages not fully migrated]
3. **Import Pattern Issues**: [specific files with incorrect import patterns]
4. **Variable Naming Issues**: [specific files with inconsistent naming]
5. **Smoke Test Failures**: [specific package validation failures]
6. **Validation Command Failures**: [specific validation commands that failed]
