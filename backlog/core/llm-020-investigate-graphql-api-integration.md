# LLM-020: Investigate GraphQL API Integration

## User Story
**As a** Data Engineer  
**I want** to evaluate GraphQL as an alternative to REST APIs for sports data integration  
**So that** we can determine if it provides better performance and developer experience for complex data queries

## Business Value
- Potential for more efficient data fetching with single queries
- Better developer experience with strongly typed schemas
- Reduced over/under-fetching of data
- Improved API evolution capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research and document 3+ GraphQL service providers relevant to sports data
- [ ] Compare GraphQL vs REST API performance for typical sports data queries
- [ ] Evaluate schema design patterns for sports analytics data models
- [ ] Assess development tooling and ecosystem maturity
- [ ] Create cost comparison analysis (if pricing data available)
- [ ] Document integration complexity and learning curve
- [ ] Identify specific use cases where GraphQL would provide clear benefits
- [ ] Create prototype integration with one GraphQL endpoint
- [ ] Document migration path from current REST APIs
- [ ] Provide recommendation with pros/cons and implementation roadmap

## Technical Considerations
- Query efficiency for complex sports data relationships
- Caching strategies and performance optimization
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Rate limiting and cost management
- Schema versioning and evolution
- Error handling and debugging capabilities

## Dependencies
None identified

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Research-only story with no production impact
- **Timeline**: 2 story points (1-2 weeks)
- **Resources**: 1 engineer for research and prototyping

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Research document completed with findings
- [ ] Prototype demonstrates key GraphQL concepts
- [ ] Recommendation provided with implementation guidance
- [ ] Follow-up stories created for implementation if recommended
- [ ] Update architecture decisions
- [ ] Revise project estimates
- [ ] Adjust technical approach

## Implementation Notes
- [Technical considerations]
- [Dependencies or prerequisites]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
