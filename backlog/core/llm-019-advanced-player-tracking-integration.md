# LLM-019: Advanced Player Tracking Integration

## Research Status: BLOCKED - Data Sources Not Viable

### Research Findings (2025-08-29)
- **NFL Next Gen Stats**: No public API access, requires expensive commercial partnerships
- **SportRadar**: Commercial licensing only ($1000s+ annually) 
- **Biometric Data**: Legally protected (HIPAA), team proprietary, no public sources
- **Conclusion**: Not viable for solo development without significant budget

## User Story
As a data analyst
I want to integrate advanced player tracking data from multiple sources
So that I can provide more accurate player performance predictions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Include GPS tracking data (BLOCKED: No public access)
- [ ] Include biometric sensor data (BLOCKED: HIPAA protected)
- [ ] Validate data quality and completeness
- [ ] Create unified player performance schema (BLOCKED: No data to validate schema)
- [ ] Test with current season data (BLOCKED: No accessible data sources)

## Implementation Notes
**BLOCKED UNTIL:**
- Budget available for commercial API licensing (SportRadar $1000s+ annually)
- Alternative public data sources identified
- Focus shifted to accessible data (social media sentiment, news analysis)

**RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES:**
- Social media sentiment analysis (Twitter/Bluesky APIs available)
- Real-time news impact scoring (RSS feeds accessible)
- Fan engagement correlation analysis (public social media data)

## Definition of Done
**STORY BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed without viable data sources
- [ ] ~~Implementation complete~~ (No data sources available)
- [ ] ~~Tests written and passing~~ (No implementation possible)
- [ ] ~~Documentation updated~~ (Research documented instead)
- [ ] Research findings documented âœ… (COMPLETED 2025-08-29)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
