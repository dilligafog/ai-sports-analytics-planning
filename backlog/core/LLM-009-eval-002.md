  The framework enables data-driven decisions about LLM feature usage with

  statistical rigor and cost analysis. Production-ready system with automated

  recommendations for feature inclusion based on lift thresholds and budget

  constraints. This unblocks evidence-based optimization of LLM features.'

# EVAL-002: Ablation studies for LLM feature lift

- **Overview**: As a researcher, I want ablation experiments so that we know what LLM features actually help.
- **Value Proposition**: Prevents cost and complexity from unjustified features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Run (Base), (Base+Market), (Base+Market+LLM minimal), (Base+Market+LLM full).
- Report per-market lift with confidence intervals.
- Keep features that pass a pre-agreed lift threshold and cost budget.

## Technical Requirements
- Bootstrap CIs; cost per 1k tokens tracked for each experiment.
- Config-driven feature toggles.
- Results written to `reports/ablation_llm.md`.

## Implementation Plan
- Add toggles and evaluator hooks.
- Run experiments on a past season sample.
- Summarize results and decide keep/drop list.

## Definition of Done
- Report published; keep/drop list committed.
- Pipeline uses only kept features by default.
