# MOD-003: Probability calibration & reliability curves

- **Overview**: As a quant, I want calibrated probabilities so that our 60% means 60% in the long run.
- **Value Proposition**: Calibration improves bankroll management and trust in the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Reliability Analysis**: Reliability plots for ATS/ML/Total created for baseline and stacker models.
- [ ] **Calibration Method**: Isotonic regression selected unless sample size too small (fallback to Platt).
- [ ] **Error Tracking**: Calibration error reported and tracked over time with < 0.05 target.
- [ ] **Visualization**: Interactive calibration plots available in dashboard.
- [ ] **Model Comparison**: Clear comparison between calibrated vs uncalibrated performance.

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Bin-based reliability and Brier decomposition with confidence intervals.
- [ ] Store calibration maps with model metadata and version control.
- [ ] Unit tests for calibration functions with edge cases.
- [ ] Automated calibration drift detection.
- [ ] GPU-accelerated calibration for large datasets.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Implement calibration utilities and reliability curve generation
2. **Week 2**: Integrate into training and inference pipelines with validation
3. **Week 3**: Generate plots and tables in `reports/`, add dashboard integration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Plots and metrics present in `reports/calibration/` directory.
- [ ] CI test covers calibration edge cases and performance thresholds.
- [ ] Inference applies correct calibration map for model version automatically.
- [ ] Documentation includes calibration maintenance procedures.
- [ ] Calibration improves betting strategy performance by â‰¥ 1% in backtesting.
