# MOD-001: Rebaseline ATS/ML/Total models with clean features

- **Overview**: As a data scientist, I want strong base models so that LLM signals can add lift on top of a solid foundation.
- **Value Proposition**: Good baselines ensure we donâ€™t attribute spurious gains to LLM features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Train baseline models for ATS, ML, and Totals using rolling features (last-5, last-10, season-to-date).
- Cross-validation with season/week grouped splits; log-loss/Brier reported.
- Feature store schema stable and documented.

## Technical Requirements
- LightGBM/XGBoost with monotonic constraints where applicable.
- Leak checks (no future odds/stats leakage).
- Feature store under `data/gold/features.parquet` keyed by `game_id, team_id`.

## Implementation Plan
- Define feature set and labels per market.
- Implement grouped CV and evaluation.
- Store calibrated outputs for stacker input.

## Definition of Done
- Reproducible training run with fixed seeds.
- Metrics recorded in `reports/metrics_baseline.md`.
- Model artifacts versioned under `models/baseline/`.
