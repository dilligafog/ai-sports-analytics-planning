# MOD-002: Meta-model stacker with LLM-aware weighting

- **Overview**: As a modeler, I want a stacker to blend base models with market info and LLM signals so that predictions adapt to context.
- **Value Proposition**: Combines numeric strength with text-derived situational awareness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Inputs: base model probs, market implied probs, selected LLM signals.
- Outputs calibrated probabilities for ATS/ML/Total; weights logged per game.
- Ablation shows improvement vs baselines â‰¥ 2% Brier reduction.

## Technical Requirements
- Logistic regression or shallow GBM; optional LLM advisory that outputs weight priors.
- Isotonic/Platt calibration over validation folds.
- Explainability: per-game breakdown of contributing inputs.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement stacker fit/predict API.
- Join features; run CV with and without LLM signals.
- Persist calibrated outputs; add SHAP-like summary or weight table.

## Definition of Done
- Ablation report written to `reports/ablation_stacker.md`.
- Per-game logs include component weights and final prob.
