# MOD-006: Production model calibration monitoring

- **Overview**: As a modeling team member, I want continuous monitoring of model calibration so that prediction confidence remains accurate over time.
- **Value Proposition**: Maintains betting edge by detecting when models become overconfident or underconfident before significant losses occur.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Real-time calibration monitoring using Brier score decomposition and reliability curves
- Alert when calibration error exceeds threshold (>0.05 for critical markets)
- Weekly calibration reports with trend analysis and recommended actions
- Integration with prediction pipeline to flag poorly calibrated periods
- Automatic model retraining triggers when calibration degrades significantly

## Technical Requirements
- Streaming calibration metrics computed on live predictions vs outcomes
- Statistical significance testing for calibration changes
- Integration with existing model evaluation framework (EVAL-001)
- Dashboard showing calibration trends across markets and time periods
- Automated alerting system with severity levels and recommended actions

## Implementation Plan
1. **Implement streaming calibration metrics** with rolling window calculations
2. **Create calibration monitoring dashboard** with historical trends
3. **Add automated alerting** for calibration degradation with action recommendations
4. **Integrate with prediction pipeline** to flag poorly calibrated periods
5. **Connect to retraining triggers** for automatic model updates

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Calibration metrics updated within 24 hours of new outcomes
- [ ] Alerts trigger when calibration error exceeds 0.05 for >7 days
- [ ] Weekly calibration reports generated automatically
- [ ] Dashboard shows calibration trends across all active models
- [ ] Integration with model retraining pipeline for automated updates
