# User Story: Backtesting & ROI Tracking

## Overview
**As a** model developer  
**I want** to backtest models against historical data with ROI metrics  
**So that** I can validate model performance in financial terms before deploying

## Value Proposition
Validates whether the prediction models would have actually made money in real-world betting scenarios. This provides a more relevant performance metric than simple accuracy and helps optimize betting strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System can run simulated bets against historical seasons
- Performance metrics include ROI, variance, and maximum drawdown
- Multiple betting strategies can be tested (e.g., flat bets, Kelly criterion)
- Results can be filtered by market type, season, team, and other factors

## Technical Requirements
- Create a `busta backtest <range>` command for the CLI
- Implement betting simulation algorithms for different strategies
- Develop ROI calculation and performance metrics
- Create visualization capabilities for performance analysis

## Implementation Plan
1. Design a backtest module architecture
2. Implement historical data loading and preparation
3. Create betting strategy simulators
4. Develop performance metrics calculations
5. Build reporting and visualization components
6. Integrate with the CLI and existing infrastructure

## Definition of Done
- Backtests align with known historical outcomes
- System can compare multiple strategies on the same dataset
- Performance metrics are accurate and comprehensive
- Results provide actionable insights for model tuning

## Related Features
- Performance Tracking System (enhancement)
- Model Training (dependency)
- Dashboard Generation (will consume this feature)
