# PREDICTIONS_OUTPUTS: Predictions & Outputs ✅ ACCEPTED

## Overview
**As a** sports bettor  
**I want** clear predictions for upcoming games  
**So that** I can make informed betting decisions

## Value Proposition
Translates model outputs into actionable predictions that drive the end-user experience. This is the core value delivery of the system that enables users to place informed betting decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅ ALL MET
- ✅ System generates predictions for all games in the current week
- ✅ Predictions include confidence scores and supporting metrics
- ✅ Outputs are formatted consistently and stored in a structured way
- ✅ Predictions are available for different betting markets

## Technical Requirements ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Implement `busta predict <week>` command
- ✅ Create prediction pipeline that uses trained models
- ✅ Develop output format with all necessary information
- ✅ Store predictions in `data/predictions/` with appropriate organization

## Implementation Plan ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Design prediction process workflow
2. ✅ Implement prediction generation for each market type
3. ✅ Create consistent output format with confidence scores
4. ✅ Develop storage strategy for predictions
5. ✅ Build integration with downstream systems (UI, reporting)

## Definition of Done ✅ ACHIEVED
- ✅ Predictions generate for all games with confidence scores
- ✅ Outputs include all necessary context for decision-making
- ✅ Prediction files are consistently formatted and organized
- ✅ Command works reliably for all supported betting markets

## Outcome Summary
Predictions pipeline successfully implemented and operational. Built on the foundation of MODEL_TRAINING_EVALUATION (80.9% accuracy) and QLT-001 data quality framework. Core value delivery mechanism now in place.
