# 📋 Backlog Grooming Session - August 29, 2025

## 🎯 Grooming Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Refine top 15 priority stories for immediate implementation readiness

**Secondary Goals**:
- Validate dependencies and remove blockers
- Standardize acceptance criteria format
- Update estimates based on recent learnings
- Identify stories that need splitting or deprioritization

## 📊 Current Backlog Status

- **Total Stories**: 100
- **High Priority (P0-P1)**: 15 stories ready for implementation
- **Draft Status**: ~30 stories need refinement
- **Accepted/Completed**: ~55 stories (mostly adhoc maintenance)

## 🔍 Grooming Focus Areas

### 1. **Top 5 Priority Stories** (Immediate Sprint)
- LLM-001: Feature Extraction from News
- LLM-002: Evidence Citation Traceability  
- MOD-005: Advanced NFL Statistics Integration
- MOD-004: NFL Player Injury Data Integration
- ADH-015: End-to-End Kaggle NFL Scores

### 2. **Dependency Validation**
- Check ING-001/ING-002 status for LLM pipeline
- Validate MOD-003 completion for abstention logic
- Confirm data pipeline readiness

### 3. **Story Refinement Needed**
- Standardize acceptance criteria format
- Add missing technical requirements
- Update estimates based on recent implementations
- Split overly complex stories

## 📝 Grooming Actions Taken
