# üìã Backlog Grooming Session - August 29, 2025

## üéØ Grooming Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Refine top 15 priority stories for immediate implementation readiness

**Secondary Goals**:
- Validate dependencies and remove blockers
- Standardize acceptance criteria format
- Update estimates based on recent learnings
- Identify stories that need splitting or deprioritization

## üìä Current Backlog Status

- **Total Stories**: 100
- **High Priority (P0-P1)**: 15 stories ready for implementation
- **Draft Status**: ~30 stories need refinement
- **Accepted/Completed**: ~55 stories (mostly adhoc maintenance)

## üîç Grooming Focus Areas

### 1. **Top 5 Priority Stories** (Immediate Sprint)
- ~~LLM-001: Feature Extraction from News~~ *(DISCOVERED: Already completed as LLM-014)*
- LLM-002: Evidence Citation Traceability  
- MOD-001: Rebaseline ATS/ML/Total models
- MOD-002: Meta-model stacker with LLM-aware weighting
- ADH-015: End-to-End Kaggle NFL Scores

### 2. **Dependency Validation**
- LLM-014 ‚úÖ completed, update dependencies from LLM-001 to LLM-014
- Check MOD-001 status for model baseline work
- Validate MOD-002 dependencies on completed LLM work

## üîç **Critical Discoveries Made**

### 1. **Duplicate Stories Identified**
- **LLM-001** and **LLM-014** were both about "Feature Extraction from News"
- **LLM-014** was already marked as **completed** with full implementation
- **LLM-001** was a duplicate we were grooming unnecessarily

### 2. **Completed Work Not Reflected**
- **LLM-014**: Full LLM pipeline with OpenAI API integration operational
- **Cost-efficient processing** at ~$0.03 per run using gpt-3.5-turbo
- **Production-safe error handling** with Pydantic validation
- **CLI integration**: `busta features llm extract` and batch operations

### 3. **Dependency Chain Issues**
- Multiple stories depended on LLM-001 (duplicate)
- Need to update dependencies to point to LLM-014
- Stories affected: LLM-002, LLM-004, LLM-006, UI components

### 4. **Backlog Cleanup Required**
- Remove or mark LLM-001 as completed/duplicate
- Update prioritization to reflect actual completion status
- Fix dependency references across all affected stories
- Validate MOD-003 completion for abstention logic
- Confirm data pipeline readiness

### 3. **Story Refinement Needed**
- Standardize acceptance criteria format
- Add missing technical requirements
- Update estimates based on recent implementations
- Split overly complex stories

## üìù Grooming Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Analyzed current prioritization structure
- [x] Identified top 15 priority stories
- [x] Reviewed story format consistency
- [x] Assessed dependency chains
- [x] **Groomed LLM-001**: Added detailed acceptance criteria, implementation plan, and definition of done
- [x] **Groomed LLM-002**: Enhanced traceability requirements and audit capabilities
- [x] **Groomed MOD-001**: Refined baseline model requirements with performance targets
- [x] **Groomed MOD-002**: Enhanced stacker model with explainability and robustness
- [x] **Groomed MOD-003**: Added calibration monitoring and visualization requirements
- [x] **Updated Prioritization**: Removed completed stories (MOD-004/MOD-005), corrected priorities
- [x] **Updated Dependencies**: Fixed dependency chains for sequential model development

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Validate remaining story dependencies
- [ ] Review estimate accuracy for groomed stories
- [ ] Update PRIORITIZATION.json with new priorities
- [ ] Generate updated sprint planning recommendations

### üìã Next Steps
- [ ] Create implementation-ready versions of remaining top 10 stories
- [ ] Update prioritization JSON with corrected priorities and estimates
- [ ] Generate updated prioritization markdown with current status
- [ ] Document grooming decisions and rationale for team review

## üéØ Success Criteria

**By end of session**:
- Top 5 stories have complete, testable acceptance criteria
- All dependencies validated and blockers identified
- Estimates reflect current team velocity
- Stories are appropriately sized (2-5 story points)
- Clear implementation path for next sprint
