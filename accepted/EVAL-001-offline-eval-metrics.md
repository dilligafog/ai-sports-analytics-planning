# EVAL-001: Offline evaluation harness & metrics tracking

- **Overview**: As a quant, I want a repeatable evaluation harness so that we can compare models and track progress.
- **Value Proposition**: Objective measurement prevents regressions.
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - 2025-08-24

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- ✅ Compute log-loss, Brier, AUC, and calibration error per market and time period.
- ✅ Produce time-series of metrics; store under `reports/metrics_history.parquet`.
- ✅ Simple HTML/MD report summarizing latest runs.

## Technical Requirements ✅
- ✅ Grouped CV by season/week; robust splits.
- ✅ Plot reliability and lift curves (matplotlib).
- ✅ Seed handling for reproducibility.

## Implementation Summary ✅
- ✅ Implemented OfflineEvaluator module with comprehensive metrics
- ✅ Added HTML report generator with interactive visualizations
- ✅ Stored artifacts and wired into CLI system
- ✅ Created test suite ensuring reliability and reproducibility

## Definition of Done ✅
- ✅ Baseline metrics recorded and versioned in parquet format
- ✅ CI pipeline integrated (ready for regression detection)
- ✅ All tests passing (11/11 test cases)
- ✅ Documentation and usage examples complete

## Usage
```bash
# Basic evaluation
busta offline-eval --dataset data.parquet --market moneyline

# Generate full report with plots
busta offline-eval --dataset data.parquet --market moneyline --generate-report

# Cross-validation with custom grouping
busta offline-eval --dataset data.parquet --market ats --group-by season --seed 42
```

## Generated Artifacts
- **HTML Reports**: `data/reports/evaluation_report_{market}.html`
- **Metrics History**: `data/reports/metrics/metrics_history.parquet`
- **Plots**: `data/reports/plots/evaluation_{market}_{timestamp}.png`
- **JSON Data**: `data/reports/metrics/evaluation_{market}_{timestamp}.json`

## Related Features
MOD-001, MOD-002, MOD-003 - Now ready for integration with baseline and ensemble models

## Lessons Learned
- Grouped cross-validation essential for preventing temporal data leakage
- Calibration analysis provides valuable insights beyond accuracy metrics
- Time-series tracking enables model performance monitoring over time
- CLI integration makes evaluation accessible to all team members
- Comprehensive testing crucial for evaluation system reliability
