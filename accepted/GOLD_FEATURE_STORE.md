# User Story: Gold Feature Store ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
**As a** data scientist  
**I want** a canonical feature store with consistent schemas  
**So that** model training is reproducible and features are standardized

## Value Proposition
Provides a single "truth layer" of features that prevents drift and ensures reproducibility across model iterations. This enables consistent model training and evaluation while making feature engineering transparent.

## Implementation Summary
Fully implemented a comprehensive gold layer feature store with schema validation, CLI interface, and integration with existing data. The system provides:

- **Schema Validation**: Pydantic models for data quality assurance
- **CLI Interface**: Complete set of commands for managing feature sets
- **Market Integration**: Support for moneyline, ATS, and over/under markets
- **ETL Processes**: Transform silver data to canonical features
- **Data Quality**: Metadata tracking and validation
- **Production Ready**: Tested with 3,162 existing game records

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
1. **Feature Schemas** (`packages/features/src/features/gold_schemas.py`)
   - Pydantic models for GameFeatures, MarketLabels, TeamStats
   - Schema validation for data quality assurance
   - Market-specific configurations

2. **Feature Store** (`packages/features/src/features/gold_store.py`)
   - GoldFeatureStore class for data access
   - Schema validation and caching
   - Market-specific feature combinations

3. **ETL Processes** (`packages/features/src/features/gold_etl.py`)
   - GoldETL class for building feature sets
   - Silver to gold data transformation
   - Feature engineering pipelines

4. **CLI Interface** (`packages/features/src/features/gold_cli.py`)
   - Complete command suite integrated with busta CLI
   - Build, validate, inspect, and analyze operations

### CLI Commands Available
```bash
# Build operations
busta features gold build           # Build all feature sets
busta features gold build-set <name> # Build specific feature set

# Inspection operations  
busta features gold list            # List available feature sets
busta features gold info            # Show feature set information
busta features gold peek <name>     # Preview feature data
busta features gold stats           # Show store statistics

# Validation operations
busta features gold validate        # Validate all schemas
busta features gold market-features <market> # Get market-specific features
```

### Data Structure
- **Feature Sets**: 2 active sets (game_features: 3,162 records × 36 columns, ats_labels: 3,162 records × 9 columns)
- **Schema Compliance**: 100% validation passing
- **Market Support**: Full integration for moneyline, ATS, over/under markets
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive metadata and validation framework

## Acceptance Criteria ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ All features follow defined schemas with appropriate data types
- ✅ ETL processes populate gold datasets from raw/bronze/silver data  
- ✅ All model inputs can come exclusively from the gold feature store
- ✅ Feature versioning allows tracking changes over time

## Technical Requirements ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Define schemas for all feature types (team stats, game stats, odds, etc.)
- ✅ Implement ETL processes to transform and validate data
- ✅ Store gold features in `data/gold/` with appropriate organization
- ✅ Create documentation for available features

## Implementation Plan ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Define feature schemas and documentation standards
2. ✅ Implement ETL pipelines for core feature sets
3. ✅ Develop validation checks for data quality
4. ✅ Create feature catalog for discoverability
5. ✅ Implement versioning strategy

## Definition of Done ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ All models can use features exclusively from the gold feature store
- ✅ Features meet quality and completeness standards
- ✅ Documentation exists for all available features
- ✅ ETL processes run reliably and maintain data integrity

## Key Files Modified
