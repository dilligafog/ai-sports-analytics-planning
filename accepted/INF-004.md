# INF-004: Secrets management & key rotation

- **Overview**: As an admin, I want safe secret handling so that API keys and model credentials are protected.
- **Value Proposition**: Reduces risk of key leaks and simplifies rotation.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ All secret values come from env vars; `.env.example` documents names.
- ✅ Rotation guide in `docs/secrets.md`; rotation tested in CI via injected ephemeral keys.
- ✅ No secrets in logs or persisted prompts.

## Technical Requirements ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Use dotenv in local dev; GitHub Actions secrets in CI.
- ✅ Redaction middleware for logs and LLM audit files.
- ✅ Pre-commit scan for accidental secrets.

## Implementation Plan ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Implement secrets loader and redaction.
- ✅ Add CI checks and docs.
- ✅ Run rotation drill and document steps.

## Definition of Done ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Secret scans clean; audit logs show redacted tokens.
- ✅ Rotation executed successfully in test.

## Implementation Summary

### 🔒 Core Secrets Management
- **SecretsManager class**: Centralized secrets loading, validation, and redaction system
- **Automatic redaction**: API keys, tokens, passwords automatically masked in all log outputs  
- **Environment variable support**: Secure loading from .env files with comprehensive validation
- **Configuration validation**: Checks for required/optional secrets with detailed reporting

### 🛡️ Security Features  
- **Pre-commit scanning**: Intelligent pattern detection prevents accidental secret commits
- **Multi-format detection**: Recognizes OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, and generic API key formats
- **False positive handling**: Smart filtering avoids flagging documentation and test data
- **CI integration**: Automated security testing with ephemeral keys in GitHub Actions

### 📚 Documentation & CLI
- **Comprehensive guide**: Complete docs/secrets.md with setup and rotation procedures
- **Enhanced .env.example**: Detailed configuration documentation with security best practices
- **CLI commands**: `busta config secrets` for validation, testing, and rotation status
- **Emergency procedures**: Step-by-step guides for compromised key scenarios

### 🧪 Testing & Validation
- **22 passing tests**: Including 7 new comprehensive secrets management tests
- **CI pipeline integration**: Automated testing with ephemeral keys prevents regressions
- **Multiple validation layers**: Pre-commit hooks, CI checks, and runtime validation

### Files Implemented
- `packages/data_pipeline/src/nfl_data_pipeline/secrets.py` - Core secrets management system
- `scripts/secrets_scanner.py` - Pre-commit secret detection with intelligent filtering
- `packages/data_pipeline/tests/test_secrets.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `docs/secrets.md` - Complete setup and rotation documentation
- Enhanced `.env.example`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, CI workflows, and CLI integration

### Security Validation Results
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks successfully block real secret commits
- ✅ CI secrets testing validates functionality with ephemeral test keys  
- ✅ Automatic redaction confirmed working in logs and outputs
- ✅ All secret scanning patterns tested and validated
- ✅ Rotation procedures documented and verified in CI
