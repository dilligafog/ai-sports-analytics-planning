# Integrate AI Sales Pitch into Web UI

## User Story

**As a** sports bettor  
**I want** to see AI-generated sales pitches directly in the web interface  
**So that** I can quickly understand the reasoning behind predictions without using the CLI

## Background

The AI_GENERATED_SALES_PITCH story delivered a powerful CLI-based AI sales pitch generation system with:
- Multi-tier inference architecture (local → remote → cloud)
- Support for all betting markets (moneyline, spread, over/under) 
- Multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, text)
- Comprehensive AI provider abstraction

This story focuses on integrating this capability into the web UI for better user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Integration
- [ ] Add "AI Pitch" button/section to game prediction cards
- [ ] Display generated sales pitches in readable format on web pages
- [ ] Support all betting markets (moneyline, spread, totals)
- [ ] Show confidence indicators and key reasoning points

### UI/UX Requirements  
- [ ] Sales pitch loads asynchronously without blocking page render
- [ ] Loading states and error handling for AI generation
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy distinguishing AI content from predictions

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Web endpoint integration with existing CLI AI system
- [ ] Frontend components for displaying formatted sales pitches
- [ ] Caching strategy for generated pitches (avoid regeneration)
- [ ] Performance optimization (target <3s load time)

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validation
- [ ] AI content quality review and approval process
- [ ] Analytics tracking for user engagement with AI pitches

## Implementation Notes

**Leverage Existing Infrastructure:**
- Reuse AI provider abstraction layer from CLI implementation
- Utilize existing multi-tier inference setup
- Integrate with current web architecture patterns

**Design Considerations:**
- AI-generated content should be clearly labeled
- Provide fallback when AI systems are unavailable
- Consider rate limiting to manage AI inference costs

## Success Metrics

- User engagement with AI pitch feature > 60%
- Average page load time increase < 1 second
- AI generation success rate > 95%
- User feedback score > 4.0/5.0

## Dependencies

- ✅ AI_GENERATED_SALES_PITCH (completed - provides core AI functionality)
- Web UI infrastructure for game predictions
- Frontend framework and component library

## Effort Estimate

**5 story points** - Medium complexity integration requiring:
- Frontend development (60%)
- Backend API endpoint creation (20%)  
- Testing and optimization (20%)
