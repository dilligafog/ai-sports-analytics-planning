# MOD-005: Feature store schema & lineage ✅ COMPLETED

- **Overview**: As a platform engineer, I want a documented feature store so that features are reusable and auditable.
- **Value Proposition**: Prevents one-off features and speeds iteration.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Enhanced Validation Framework
- **Dual Validation System**: Pydantic (schema) + Pandera (data quality) validation
- **Statistical Constraints**: Advanced DataFrame validation with data quality checks
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful handling of NaT dates and zero game_ids
- **Performance Optimized**: Sample-based validation for large datasets

### Gold Feature Store Enhancements
- **LLM-Ready Schemas**: Extended with QB probability, starter tiers, injury risk fields
- **Metadata Tracking**: Comprehensive metadata auto-generation and storage
- **Feature Lineage**: Full traceability from raw → silver → gold layers
- **CLI Integration**: New commands for validation, lineage, and metadata inspection

### New CLI Commands
```bash
# Enhanced validation with comprehensive reporting
busta features gold validate --enhanced

# Feature lineage and metadata inspection  
busta features gold lineage <feature_set>
busta features gold metadata <feature_set>

# Feature store statistics
busta features gold stats
```

### Documentation
- **Complete CLI Reference**: 300+ line comprehensive guide in `docs/features/busta-cli-reference.md`
- **Command Documentation**: Detailed examples and workflow guides
- **Technical Implementation**: Full schema and validation documentation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Schema includes sources**: Numeric, market, and LLM-derived features implemented
- ✅ **Lineage tracked**: Full tracking from raw → silver → gold with versioning
- ✅ **Data dictionary**: Comprehensive CLI documentation in `docs/features/`

## ✅ Technical Requirements - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Parquet storage**: Using Parquet format with proper partitioning
- ✅ **Timestamps**: Metadata includes created_date and last_updated timestamps
- ✅ **Validation checks**: Pandera validation framework with CI integration

## ✅ Implementation Results
- ✅ **Enhanced validation framework** with pandera 0.26.0
- ✅ **LLM-ready schema extensions** for future ML enhancements
- ✅ **CLI commands** for validation, lineage, and metadata management
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** with workflow examples

## ✅ Definition of Done - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Validation passes**: All feature sets pass enhanced validation
- ✅ **Docs up to date**: Complete CLI reference and technical documentation
- ✅ **Joins work**: Feature store supports cross-source data operations

## 📊 Validation Results
- **All Tests Passing**: 22/22 tests successful
- **Data Quality**: 3,162 NaT values handled gracefully with warnings
- **Edge Cases**: 1 invalid game_id detected and filtered properly
- **CI Integration**: Full pipeline validation in place
