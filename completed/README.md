# Completed Stories (Awaiting Acceptance Review)

This directory contains documentation for stories that have been completed in implementation but are awaiting final acceptance review and migration to the `accepted/` directory.

## Story Lifecycle

Stories move through the following stages:
1. **Creation** → `backlog/` - New story with basic structure
2. **Refinement** → Stay in `backlog/` until ready
3. **Ready** → Move to `active/` when implementation starts
4. **Completion** → Move to `completed/` with outcome notes ← **This Stage**
5. **Acceptance** → Move to `accepted/` when verified and meeting all criteria

## Current Status

**Stories in completed/**: 0  
**Recently moved to accepted/**: 19 stories (2025-01-27)

All previously completed stories have been reviewed and formally accepted. They are now located in the `accepted/` directory.

## Next Steps for New Completed Stories

When implementation agents complete new stories, they should:

1. **Move story to completed/** with implementation outcome notes
2. **Include links** to implementation PRs and commits
3. **Document verification steps** completed
4. **Note any follow-up items** or technical debt identified
5. **Request planning agent review** for formal acceptance

## For Planning Agents

Review completed stories for:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met and verified
- ✅ Implementation outcome notes and PR links included
- ✅ Verification steps documented
- ✅ Any lessons learned captured
- ✅ Follow-up items identified and planned

Once reviewed and validated, move stories to `accepted/` directory with updated status.
