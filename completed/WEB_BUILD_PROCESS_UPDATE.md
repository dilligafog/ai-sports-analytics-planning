# Web Build Process Modernization - UPDATE

## Latest Changes

We've successfully modernized our web build process:

1. **Template-Based Building**:
   - All HTML/CSS/JS is now in separate template files
   - Jinja2 is used for template rendering
   - Clean separation of content from logic

2. **Build Simplification**:
   - Removed legacy HTML-in-Python option
   - `busta build-web` now always uses templates
   - Automatic Jinja2 installation if needed

3. **Added Deployment Features**:
   - Added `--dry-run` option to preview deployment
   - Better error handling and reporting

## Using the New System

```bash
# Build web package (always uses templates now)
busta build-web

# Preview deployment without actually deploying
busta deploy-web --dry-run

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
busta deploy-web
```

## File Structure

```
templates/
├── landing.html        # Main landing page template
├── dashboard.html      # Dashboard template
└── assets/
    ├── styles.css      # CSS for all pages
    └── main.js         # JavaScript functionality
```

## Future Enhancements

The next step is to gradually move to the separate UI repository approach:

1. Continue building with templates for now
2. Start developing UI components in the nfl-predictions-ui repo
3. Move to a complete separation when ready

## Compatibility Note

The legacy HTML-in-Python builder has been removed. If you still need it for any reason, check out the code before August 23, 2025.
